To make grid items dynamic use fractional units known as `fr`. This unit allow to distribute whatever remaining space is left in the grid. For example, if we have a four-column grid with a total width of 400px and four grid items each on a column track assigned 1fr as their size, all of the grid items should be given one fraction of that 400px of space, which is 100 pixels.

Without fractional units.

With fractional units.
```css
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr);
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);
```

Using fr, all of the items will be the same height and width. This is useful, specially with resize:both. Check the [code pen](https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/WNZbbgG). 

`grid-template-rows` and columns don't need to have the same fractional units. In this example, the use of the repeat function means: repeat twice two fractional units (that's two tracks), and then repeat 3 times one fractional units, that's three tracks, so the total of tracks are five, and the total of lines are six.

>The number at the beginning of the repeat function determines the total amount of tracks, and the sum of the fractional units, determine the total of grid lines. 

## Mixing units
I can mix units with fractional units.
