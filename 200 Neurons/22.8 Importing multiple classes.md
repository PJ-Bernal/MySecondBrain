## Group imports

When importing multiple classes from the same namespace I can group them together. 

Here I'm importing two classes from the paymentgateway/paddle namespace.

 I can group with `{, }

## Import the name space
Or import the namespace itself, and then use the qualifying namespace in the constructor. This is useful when I have to importing a lot of classes from the same namespace and instead of listing all of them within ( , ) I rather do as the image below.

However Gio prefer to have everything imported in the use statement as I can see directly what classes functions or constants I'm using. 

Alias also work when importing name spaces.

## Importing rules are profile bases
This means an included file won't inherit the classes that were imported in the parent file. In this case, view/layout is not imported the two use statements, so that file (view) can't use those classes. If that file need those classes (the highlighted ones), the imports must be done within that document.
