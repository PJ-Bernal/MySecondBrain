The og code only changes the data in the test, but the implementation is the same.

# Create a class for the data driven test
Create a class for the data driven test.

# Creating the theory
Then use decorate the test with theory and use the method parameter instead of the hard-coded values.

# Providing inline data
use the inline data attribute to pass hard-coded data. If the method have, let's say, three attributes, then, the inline data attribute must have three attributes.

I can't pass GUIDs directly to the inline data attribute, that's why the image is passing strings. But the inline convert strings to guids.

# Testing
The test explorer is enough to recognize the number of inline data attributes, so I can decide which one to test, in this example are two inline attributes, so the explorer shows two tests.
