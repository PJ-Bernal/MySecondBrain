[[12.12 React|React]]

Old code bases uses class-based components where functional components were called state-less (then hooks appear allowing to control the state). 

## Building a class component
>[!lblank-container|float-left]

>import { Component } from "react";

>class ClassInput extends Component {
>  // Some code goes here
>}
>```

React classes require a special class called `Component` that acts as base class to be extended to my class.



### Adding a constructor
>[!lblank-container|float-left]
>```jsx
>import { Component } from "react";
>
>class ClassInput extends Component {
>  constructor(props) {
>    super(props);
>  }
>  // Some more code goes here
>}
>
>export default ClassInput;
>```

The props are passed into the constructor (that gets called when the instance is created), and `super()` executes the constructor of the parent `Component` class, allowing to use `this` inside the component. 

If the component doesn't have any props, I can leave those empty.
