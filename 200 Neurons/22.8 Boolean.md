[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

A boolean data type represents a true or false values. It is case insensitive `$var = true;` is the same as `$var = TRUE;` True is represented as 1, and false is represented with nothing. 

>[!info] Other data types can be converted to either true or false.  
>- 0 or –0 integers
>- 0.0 or -0.0 float 
>- ‘ ‘ an empty string or ‘0’ 
>- [] empty arrays 
>- null
>>Anything else, even negative numbers will be evaluated as true. 

>[!example]
>```PHP
>if(-5){
>    echo “yes”;
>}
>//yes
>$var = “false”;//This is not an empty string so its true
>if($var){
>    echo “yes”;
>}
>//yes

## How to print the Boolean value?
Simply echo the variable, `echo $trueVar;//1; echo $falseVar;// `
## Why true is printed as 1 and false as nothing?

This is because when echoing, PHP will try to cast it into a string, so casting true to string is 1 and false is nothing. In the following example, both code lines are essentially the same. 

```PHP
echo $trueVar;
echo (string) $trueVar; //this is what PHP internally do, but I’m not required to
```
## How to check if a variable is Boolean
`is_bool()` function checks if a variable is a Boolean, either true or false, and returns true if the variable is a boolean, false otherwise. The function doesn’t convert or coerce any to a boolean type. 

>[!example]
>```PHP
> $var = false;
$check = is_bool($var);// true
>if($check){
>    echo "yes";
>}
>// yes //because the variable is a Boolean 
>var_dump($check);//bool(true). 
>$check = (string) true;
>var_dump(is_bool($check)); // bool (false) BE MINDFUL $check IS NOT a bool, is a STRING
