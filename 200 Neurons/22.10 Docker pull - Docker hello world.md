## Download an image that's already on my computer
Here, there is no pull or download process because Docker confirms, using the Digest hash, my image is the latest.

- `Using default tag:`. Docker images can have tags which act like version identifiers. Tags allow you to pull specific versions of an image. For example, nginx:1.19. If no version is specify, Docker assumes I want the latest, like in this case. 
- `latest` It doesn't necessarily refers to the latest version of the image, but the most recert stable version that is found in the repository. 
- `Digest` refers to a unique and immutable identifier for a specific image version. I can pull images using the Digest and can be a good idea to make sure a college has my same image, to do this I have to use `@` after the name of the image. `docker pull ubuntu@hashcodehere`.
