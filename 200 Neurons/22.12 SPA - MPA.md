## SPA and client routing
SPA work with a single browser session, allowing the user to navigate a website without requesting entire webpages, by requesting only what the user interact with. This is known as client side routing, where the user never leaves the page is on; the routing is handled by JS. 

In the client-side rendering all request are intercepted and handled, in this case, by React. 

The image shows the traditional MPA model in which each user interaction through the browser triggers a server request, whose response is the entire webpage to load. In SPA, the browser loads a single HTML and leverages JS to dynamically updates the content of the webpage.

>>### Advantages
>>- Faster loading times: SPA loads the necessary components once, subsequent updates what are needed.
>>- Smooth user experience.
>>- Easier to maintain and scale.
>>- Offline functionality allowing the user keep using the website using the cache. 
>
>>### Disadvantages
>>- Initial load time.
>>-  Poor SEO.
>>- Security and memory leaks.
>>- When a browser reloads, it notifies screen-readers of new content to read, but in client side routing, the notifications must be made manually. 
## MPA
MPA request the whole webpage on every user interaction. This websites use server-based routing. 

When the user request a new webpage, the browser 'removes' everything from the page and build from the ground the new webpage.

For MPA, requesting and loading HTML is cheap, and shared resources like style sheets, fonts and images present in the cache don't have to be loaded again. 

Additionally, modern browsers wait the for the new webpage not only to load, but to be ready for the user, in order to appear.
