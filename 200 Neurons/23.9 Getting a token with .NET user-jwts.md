# About user-jwts
Often, validation and creating the token is handled at a central location that could be a service another team has created and manages. However, this is common handled by a proven identity provider or a product like MS Entra ID (past azure active directory), etc.

The user-jwts is used to create a user-defined token on the fly to facilitate testing. See the manage json webt oken in developmemnt with dontnet user jtws documentation.

# Creating a user jwts
In the console inside of the project folder, execute: dotnet user-jwts create. This creates a default token

## Expecting the default token

Unique name and sub identify the user. 

jti is the token identifier that is set to the id showed in the console.

The audience should include at least one that is use during development. The other URIs comes from the launchsettings.json file.

This means user-jwts look at that launch file and creates all potential URIs of these profiles to the audience list.

The iss has a default value given by the user-jwts.
Up to this point this token shouldn't have access to the api because in the app settings file the issuer must be 7169 and the audience is the city info api

## Modifying the token
![[Pasted image 20250128110341.png]]

This is a new token but is not enough because the token is not using the correct secret.

Detail the console says the signature validation failed

![[Pasted image 20250128110652.png]]

Get the secret using the user-jwts. Keys are link to issuers, to is required to pass the issuer to get the key.

![[Pasted image 20250128110819.png]]

Then, copy the key to the app settings file

![[Pasted image 20250128110840.png]]


Detail, when creating tokens with user-jwts, the schemes key is added automatically, tha contaisn the default issuer and audiences used by the user-jwts, those values are picked automatically by the jwt bearer authentication middleware. 

Copy the token 

![[Pasted image 20250128111133.png]]

Paste in post man

![[Pasted image 20250128111154.png]]

## WHen the token has to pass a policy validation
Getting any poi has a authentication validation, and by default, the token claims are not being used.  

![[Pasted image 20250128111811.png]]

The policy is not fulfilled because the poi must be from antwerp, and for that the token needs a city claim, and detail the image of the claims, there's o city claim over there. 

![[Pasted image 20250128111900.png]]

# Generate a token with a specific claim
![[Pasted image 20250128112004.png]]

Detail this is a more user-defined token, and not the default one.

![[Pasted image 20250128112027.png]]

Then paste the token and is working

# About user-jwts
Allow to not only create, but store, manage, print, and delete tokens for testing. 

# About security
Tokens are signed. When using a token service or idd provider,  those use private keys for signing and matching public keys for signature validation. The public key is available, the private won't. Meaning user-jwts will never be able to generate tokens signed in a way that is valid, because for that, it would need a private key.
