# About object initialization
When the fields/properties are growing, object initialization allow to map properties values passed as 'arguments' to the constructor invocation, without hardcoding a constructor. 

Thanks to object initializers, a hardcoded constructor is not needed, but if present, OI can also be used.

>[!important]
>Object initialization can be used in any part an object can be instantiated, this means, inside of a constructor invocation, see third example. 
# Using object initialization 
```c#
public class Product
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Amount { get; set; }
}

Product p1 = new Product() { Name = "Eggs", Amount = 123 };
```

Object initialization allow to pass properties as 'arguments' in any order (no constructor method, no order the arguments need to follow), specifying which one to choose. 

## When a constructor is hardcoded
In this example, mas items in stock is a private field with a fix value.

Therefore, when creating the instance, the code shows explicitly the name and the value for each property. And the property inside, in this case, is the id.
