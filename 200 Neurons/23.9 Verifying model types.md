This test will check the type returned by the action result. 

The arrange for this one is the same used in the previous note, so, use a construct and dispose approach to set up the test. No need for dispose, there's nothing to dispose.

This is the first test for the previous note.

# Creating the test
The arrange is done, the act is the same, but in this case, I need to caste the variable of the action result into the test object result, and then, I can access its Value property. Now, be mindful the action result is returning an I enumerable.

So I can't use assert is type, it doesn't work on interfaces, assert is type check if the type is the same. In this case, use assert is assigable from, passing the value to check.

This line is a warning because I could have a null here, which is not ideal, see the next note for more information.
