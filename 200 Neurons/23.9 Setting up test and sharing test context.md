When creating a class for a test, is usually that several test arrange section are the same. In this example, creating an employee instance.

# The test context
When the above happens, I can write a one single arrange statement and share it. `XUnit` offers several methods to share test context, depending on the scope and the expense of the test.
## Constructor and dispose
This method creates a single test context and dispose method, where each test will have their own test context and dispose method, the context is recreated for each test.  
## Class fixture
Create a single test object context shared among all test in a class, where the context is clean up after **all** tests in the class have finished. Use this when the context creating and the clean up is expensive. 

This doesn't mean a test should depend on changes made to the context in other test. Test must remain isolated always. 
## Collection fixture
Create a single test context share among test but in several classes, the clean up is done when all the test in all classes are finished.
