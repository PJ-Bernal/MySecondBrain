[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]
## Function declaration
Use the `function` keyword, followed by the function's identifier, the list of parameters (comma separated) and the code to execute.

```javascript
function identifier(parameter1, parameter2, ... parameterN) {
 // body
}
```
>[!blank-container|float-right]
>![[Pasted image 20240915114049.png|center|200]]

### Identifier as a binding
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```js
>function test () {
>  console.log("Hi!");
>}
>
>test;
>//ƒ test() {
>//    console.log("Hi!");
>//}

Declarations **create a bind** between the identifier and the function's body in the current scope.


This binding associates the function identifier with the function object. So in theory I can use the binding as any object. Because of this association, the functions identifier, becomes a property of the function object.

In this case `test.name` will output `"test"`.  
### Scope
In strict mode, when a Function Declaration is within a code block, it’s visible everywhere inside that block. But not outside of it.

In this example, the first two `welcome` function invokes work because they are in the same code block in which the function is declared. 

```javascript
"use strict";
let age = 16; // take 16 as an example

if (age < 18) {
  welcome();               // \   (runs)
                           //  |
  function welcome() {     //  |
    alert("Hello!");       //  |  Function Declaration is available
  }                        //  |  everywhere in the block where it's declared
                           //  |
  welcome();               // /   (runs)

} else {

  function welcome() {
    alert("Greetings!");
  }
}

// Here we're out of curly braces,
// so we can not see Function Declarations made inside of them.

welcome(); // Error: welcome is not defined
```

To correct this, use a function expression to create a variable within the global scope like this:

```javascript
"use strict";
let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

let welcome;

if (age < 18) {

  welcome = function() {
    alert("Hello!");
  };

} else {

  welcome = function() {
    alert("Greetings!");
  };

}

welcome(); // ok now
```
## Function expression
Allow to create a function in the middle of any assignment expression or another syntax construct (that's why it's called function expression). Its like saying: create a function and put it into the variable sayHi. 

Now the variable `sayHi` has the return value of the new function.

```javascript
let sayHi = function(name) {
  alert( `Hello, ${name}` );
}; //Don't forget the semicolon at the end
sayHi("John");//Hello John
```

>- Detail the function don't have a name, this is allowed for function expressions. 
>- The semicolon is required because any variable declaration needs it `let var = ...;` the semicolon is not part of the function syntax. 

Remember I can redefine function expressions, see [[22.5 Class expressions - class declarations#Redefining classes||this note]]. 
### Anonymous function expressions
Function expression can be anonymous functions (see above) or have a name, in which case I can use the name as a return value for the function itself to be used (useful when the function needs to operate by itself several times over a value the function self return). The name scope the function body.

```js
const math = {
  factit: function factorial(n) {
    console.log(n);
    if (n <= 1) {
      return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  },
};

math.factit(3); //3;2;1;
```

## Function declaration vs expression
- A Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined. For example, a global Function Declaration is visible in the whole script, no matter where it is (That’s due to internal algorithms. When JavaScript prepares to run the script, it first looks for global Function Declarations in it and creates the functions.)

```javascript
sayHi("John"); // Hello, John

function sayHi(name) {
  alert( `Hello, ${name}` );
}
```

- A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.

```javascript
sayHi("John"); // Uncaught ReferenceError: sayHi is not defined

let sayHi = function(name) {  // (*) no magic any more
  alert( `Hello, ${name}` );
}; //function can be called after this point
```
