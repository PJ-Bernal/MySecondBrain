[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

By default, browser apply default settings to every webpage, like bolder `h1` elements or blue underline link on `a` elements, margins and paddings. All of this is part of the user-agent stylesheet that ensures basic styling for webpages without CSS. 

Each browser has its own set of user-agent stylesheets so the default styles do vary slightly between browsers.
