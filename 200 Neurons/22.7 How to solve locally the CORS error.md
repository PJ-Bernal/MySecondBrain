## What is the error

![[Pasted image 20240829123026.png]]

The error should be fixed from the server side because the answer must contain a header allowing that specific webpage under that domain to use that resource. 

This is not a server error, but a browser security one, because the browser has to check if it has the capability to use the resource.

"No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource". This often means the server isn't configured to allow requests from your origin

## How to fix it

This is a part solution because the backend is responsible of solving this. However, I want to use locally the resource (for example, I need an API but I can't). In the network tab, click on the error, and add the following header.

Again, this allow me to fix the error locally but the server needs to be fixed.

**Never** use this in production.


## Extending the solution
I can modify other headers in case I need to fix something that is being return incorrectly.
