## Return values and Ruby laziness
In ruby I can use `&&`, `||` and `!` (not). In Ruby the `and` and `or` operators exists, but they are inherited by Perl and behave quite differently; check [this](https://graceful.dev/courses/the-freebies/modules/ruby-language/topic/episode-125-and-or/) video for a full explanation.

>[!warning] Remember this
>- When using logical operators, always thinks in term of what the operand is returning!
>- &&, || and !, they return the result of the expression that gets evaluated, so they not always returns true or false, in the below example the expression returns nil, not false.

Since the first puts return nil, Ruby doesn't need to execute the right side, thus, it returns the left side

```ruby
 puts("this isn't important") && puts("THIS IS IMPORTANT!!!")
"this isn't important"
=>nil
```

- `&&` if true (when both operands return true) returns the last evaluated operand. If false, the second operand is never executed, returns the first evaluated operand. Something like the [[22.8 Short circuit#^5b2340|short circuit in PHP]].

```ruby
irb :004 > nil && 'foo'   # last evaluated operand is nil
=> nil

irb :005 > 3 && 'foo'     # last evaluated operand is 'foo'
=> 'foo'

irb :006 > 'foo' && 3     # last evaluated operand is 3
=> 3
```

- `||` It requires only one operand truthy to evaluate to true. If the first operand is true, the second is not executed and the first one is returned. If the second is true, the second operand is return. If both are false, return the last one. 

```ruby
irb :001 > 3 || 'foo'     # last evaluated operand is 3
=> 3

irb :002 > 'foo' || 3     # last evaluated operand is 'foo'
=> 'foo'

irb :003 > nil || 'foo'   # last evaluated operand is 'foo'
=> 'foo'

nil || false
=> false
```

- `!` reverse the logic of an **expression**, not only the literal. `if !(10 < 5)`

>[!info] && and || don't always return true or false
>They have another use when used for non-boolean values.

## Bug prone

I want to make sure the variable gets the appropriate boolean value, so an if or ternary operator is the solution to this.

The result of both examples is a boolean value of either true or false for the is_ok variable. 

```ruby
is_ok = (foo || bar) ? true : false

if (foo || bar)
  is_ok = true;
else
  is_ok = false;
end
```

## A shorter way - boolean type coercion
I can use `!!`, that is not a new operator, but a negation followed by another negation, `!(!a)`. The inner ! converts the value of a to false if it is truthy, or true if a is falsy. The outer ! then flips true to false or false to true. In the end, we end up with a boolean value instead of a truthiness value.

```ruby
3 # this is a number, is not a boolean yet
!3 # This cast the number to false, even the value is true
!!3 #This don't cast, but flip the last boolean value, making 3 a true boolean value
irb :002 !!nil   # nil is falsy, !nil is true, !true is false
=> false
```

## `||=` 
Useful in situations like when you don't want to override whatever's already been set, but you want something to be there.

It basically expands to `thing_a || thing_a = thing_b`. So if thing_a hasn't been set to anything, it becomes thing_b, otherwise it keeps its original value. This is a clear advantage of using operator precedence.
