[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Having a script and migrated up the db, I can use the irb to test the script methods. In this example, this specific file require the ar file, so first I need to load that in the irb and the I can call each method directly.

In this case, the customer table have been migrate and populated with data, the ghost no. The return values of the irb **are objects** so I can have on disposition all the build in methods.

In the following example, the return value is a hash so I can save the return value in a variable and use the classic hash syntax to call a value.
