![[Pasted image 20250204150907.png]]

to request json use the content aceept.

![[Pasted image 20250204150927.png]]

# But the default format was JSON
Before chaining the add newton soft json, the default format change to XML. When chaining that method, it removes the System.test.json formatter from the list and afterwards adds json formatters at the end of the list. 


![[Pasted image 20250204151039.png]]

So move the XML formatter to the end.
