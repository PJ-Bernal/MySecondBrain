[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

The scope indicates the boundary where the variable can be access of. There are a global and local scope. The majority of variables in PHP only have a single scope and it spans within the included and required files as well. 
## Global scope
Declaring a variable in the main script (not within a function) gives it a global scope, meaning its available throughout the the script and to the scripts that are included after using the include/require statements.

In this case, the variable `$x` will be available within the script1 file

The first image was taken after the last line on the second image. Detail I'm changing dynamically the variable in both scripts. 

## Local scope
Variables within a function have local scope. The variable gets destroyed outside of the scope boundary.

Based on the image above, to use the variable x within the function `foo()` I have three methods:
- Define the variable in function.

- Define as a parameter and pass the global variable as an argument when calling the function.

## Global keywords
- Or use the global keywords to access variables within the global scope. ![[Pasted image 20240308111504.png|center|350]]

>[!important]
>Calling a variable with the global keyword makes it a reference variable, meaning any change within the function is a change to the global variable.

Global variables are also called superglobals, and PHP has multiple superglobals to use. 

>[!important]
>Super globals are something to avoid at all cost, it makes code harder to read, to maintain and can introduce bugs. Instead of using the `global` within a function, just use parameters and returns to get the data in and out of a function. 
### How global variables are store
PHP stores global variables within an associative array called `$GLOBALS` where the key is the variable named and the value is its value.

## Static variables 
They are regular variables with a local scope that is not destroyed outside of its boundary and retains its value. 

Here, the browser will wait 6 seconds, and then print 10, three times. The browser wait 6 seconds because each echo is calling the function. In this case, when the getValue function ends, the value and other variables used are destroyed. 

![[Pasted image 20240308113547.png|center|350]]

I don't want the user to wait 6 or more seconds, so static allow me to **cache** the value within the function for the next time is being called. So I add `static` to the variable and create and a if, to guarantee once the variable exists, the expensive function don't execute. 

![[Pasted image 20240508155639.png|center|350]]

In this case, when the function is being called for second time, within the local function scope, `$value` already has a value, therefore, the re-assignation to null is not made, the if is false, the expensive function is not called, and the value is returned again. In this case, 10 is printed 3 times, but the application sleeps for 2 seconds, not 6. 

I can confirm this, because processing is printed once, meaning the expensive application is being called once. 
![[Pasted image 20240508155812.png|center|350]]

Also, detail processing is not being printed more than once confirming the expensive application was called only once. 

>[!important]
>Static variables are **so powerful** to cache things. 

>[!important]
>In this example both the expensive function and the other function don't have any parameters, so the expensive function value never changes. If that value change over time, then static is not the best option to use, because as seen previously, the function is being called ONCE, so the further results won't be take into account.
