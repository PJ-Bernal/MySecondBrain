Method safety and method Idempotency are two principles of the HTTP standard. This table helps to decide which method to use when doing something.

# About method safety
A method is safe when it doesn't change the resource representation (not the content) only, like GET and HEAD. This don't mean other types of manipulation can't happen as a result of a GET request. 

Any change on the resource content shouldn't request by the consumer of the API. 
# About Idempotent methods
A method is Idempotent when it can be called multiple times with the same result, it'll always have the same side effects.
