Events propagate through the DOM tree, thus, clicking on a button involves clicking on its div, and the browser itself. There are two main event models: event bubbling and event capturing.

>[!important]
>The event flow check for events of the same type, in this example, the event type is `click`. So if any other DOM node has an event listener of that even type, then I could be triggered. 
## Event bubbling
>[!multi-column]
>
>An event starts at the most specific element and then flows upward toward the least specific element (the document or even window).
>%% %%
>This is the event bubbling of clicking a button.
>%% %% 
>Note that modern web browsers bubble the event up to the window object.

>[!important]
>For both, bubbling and capturing when an event is triggered, events are check node by node. So, in the bubbling, the button has an event, then if the div has an event listener, it will be executed and so on. In the capturing phase, only the listener that are true are consider in the event flow.


```html
<div id="parent">
    <div id="child">
        Click me!
    </div>
</div>
```

For even bubbling
```js
document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log('Parent clicked');
});

document.getElementById('child').addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log('Child clicked');
});
//Child clicked
//Parent clicked
```

For event capturing:
```js
document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log('Parent clicked');
}, true);

document.getElementById('child').addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log('Child clicked');
}, true);
//Parent clicked
//Child clicked
```
