A Node style to handle errors is to reserve the first parameter of the callback function to be an `error`, simply because the high-end function can simply fail and some times I can't predict that; maybe the read file method fails, who knows.

```js
var fs = require('fs')

 fs.readFile('/Does/not/exist', handleFile)

 function handleFile (error, file) {
   if (error) return console.error('Uhoh, there was an error', error)
   // otherwise, continue on and use `file` in your code
 }
```

Linters can be configure to handle this. The simplest one to use is called standard. All you have to do is run $ standard in your code folder and it will show you every callback in your code with an unhandled error.
