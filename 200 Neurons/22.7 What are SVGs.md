SVGs is a powerful image format to create high-quality and dynamic images. It's a scalable image format, meaning they can scale to any size and retain the quality without increasing the file size. They also allow modifying the images programmatically, changing its properties with CSS and JS.  

They are often used for: icons, graphs/charts, large, simple images, patterned backgrounds and apply effects to other elements via SVG filters.
