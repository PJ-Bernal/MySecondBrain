# Selecting a single node
When I select an element by its id or tag name, TS infer the element with the correspond HTML element type.

However, when using the `document.getElementsByClassName` this will return a `HTMLCollectionOf<Element>` and not `HTMLElements`. This means I can't access properties available for HTML elements.

I need to check if the element is an HTML element

## Selecting a node that contains a group of nodes
If a div has children, the query selector method returns the element, and not an HTML element. TS doesn't know what element `#coffees` is. In this example, coffees is a div that contains p elements.

Therefore, I can tell TS what I'm going to grab is an HTML element.

# Selecting multiple elements
Query selector all returns a node list of elements.

I should generic the type

## Query child elements
I can select the parent element, and then query over it.
