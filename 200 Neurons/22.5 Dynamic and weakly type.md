>[!info|float-right-small] Dynamic vs static typying

Dynamic means variable types, values and even functions are created, modified or deleted by the interpreter during runtime (not compile time), they change dynamically; that's why there is no need to declare variable types (int, string, etc.) when declaring such (variables can hold different value types during runtime, they aren't associated with any particular value type). 

Even though types are not declare, they exists and are assigned by the JS interpreter (the engine).   

```js
let a = 10;
a = "dog" // No need for declaration with let, var or const
a = [1, 2]
console.log(a) // [1, 2]
```

There is no a built-in feature to control this, thus Typescript or other libraries are needed. Additionally, due to the [[22.5 Variable hoisting - declaration vs initialization - hoisting functions - hoisting classes - nested functions|variable hoisting]], there is no need to declare a variable before being used, moreover, it is not even necessary to declare it!

>>let variable;

>>name = "athenea";
>>console.log("name");

Finally, this dynamism prone code to errors as they only appear once the code has been interpreted and the interpreter avoids the variable type validation; meanwhile in static languages, the code won't compile unless all the values and types are known upfront. 

## Weakly typed
>[!quote]- from MDN
>Â JS allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.

Remember [[22.5 Type coercion and type conversion - conversion string to number and number to string - string concatenation|type coercion and type conversion]]. Weakly type means JS defines by itself the value type of a variable, which is error prone. 

```javascript
const foo = 42; // foo is a number
const result = foo + "1"; // JavaScript coerces foo to a string, so it can be concatenated with the other operand
console.log(result); // 421
```

Automatic casting could be convenient but can cause unexpected bugs due to a unexpected coercion behavior, in another direction (cast happened from string to number, but I want the opposite). JS disallowed certain implicit casting for bigInts and symbols.
