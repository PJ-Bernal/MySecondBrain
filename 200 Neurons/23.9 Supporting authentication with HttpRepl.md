Bring back the authorize attributes, then connect to the api with Httprepl local host –openapi and then the swagger version for testing. Then navigate to an endpoint and make a request to get a 401 unauthorize.

# Get a token
The authenticate endpoint is NOT in the OpenApi specification version 2, it wasn’t added to that version. However, httprepl can still send a request to it.  

>[!important]
>- As long as an endpoint exists, sending a request will work, meaning loading the openAPi definition is helpful but is not requested.
>- The OpenAPI specification is a descriptive, not an enforcement document, therefore, if an endpoint exists in the API, httprepl can still interact with it. 

[question:: how the open api specification 'document' is created]

To get a token, navigate to the authentication endpoint, this message says the endpoint is not part of the open api specification but that doesn’t matter, the request should work.

After navigate to the endpoint and send a request using a post method, the notepad open with no sample request because the authentication endpoint is not within the openapi specification.

Then, click yes and send the request, the same one using with postman. Save, and the token is created.

In the past, once the token was created, I can send an authorization header as bearer token, then paste the token and make the authenticated request.

But I can set the token as a global header value, executing: `set header Authorization "Bearer <paste the token>"`.

After doing this all future send request will have that authorizatrion hader as bearer with the token.

So, navigating to api/v2/cities get will bring the three cities.
