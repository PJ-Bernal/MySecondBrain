[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

When two objects have the same class type, one can access the private or protective attributes and methods of the other one. 

In this example, the method `copyFrom` parameter is a `Transaction` object called `$transaction` (this is only a name). This parameter is the same as the current class object `$this`, so I can invoke private/protective attributes and methods.
