[[13.3 Clean code]]

>Junior developers rely on comments to tell the story when they should be relying on the code to tell the story. Comments are narrative asides; important in their own way, but in no way meant to replace plot, characterization, and setting.

It might be tempting to have comments that explain everything the code is doing. This is not a good practice. When commenting on code, the current functionality is explained in terms of variables and results.

>[!quote] Structure and interpretation of computer programs
>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
## I should be using Git
It might be tempting to have comments in your code that explain the changes or additions you have made. For example:

```javascript
/**
 * 2023-01-10: Removed unnecessary code that was causing confusion (RM)
 * 2023-03-05: Simplified the code (JP)
 * 2023-05-15: Removed functions that were causing bugs in production (LI)
 * 2023-06-22: Added a new function to combine values (JR)
 */
 ```

Commenting out something while testing something else is, of course, ok, but once a piece of code is not needed, just delete it. Don’t have something like this hanging around in your files:

```javascript
theFunctionInUse();
// oldFunction();
// evenOlderUselessFunction();
// whyAmIEvenHereImAncient():
```
## Tell why, not how
Comments are not met to describe the a code functionality in pseudocode, but why it works. 

```javascript
// This function increments the value of index to move to the next element
function incrementI(i) {
  i = i + 1;
  return i;
}

// Good Example - the code tells all that is needed

function moveToNextElement(index) {
  index = index + 1;
  return index;
}
```

In the good example no comments are needed at all as the function is self explanatory.

>[!important]
>This doesn’t mean good code should lack comments. In many situations, well-placed comments are priceless.

For example, comments that help to get a better understand on why the function was coded in that way. 

>[!important]
>While comments are neither inherently good or bad, they are frequently used as a crutch. You should always write your code as if comments didn't exist. This forces you to write your code in the simplest, plainest, most self-documenting way you can humanly come up with.
>
>when you can't possibly imagine any conceivable way your code could be changed to become more straightforward and obvious – then, and only then, should you feel compelled to add a comment explaining what your code does.

This is another good example that comments are not always required.

```javascript
r = n / 2;
while ( abs( r - (n/r) ) > t ) {
  r = 0.5 * ( r + (n/r) );
}
System.out.println( "r = " + r );
```

This is not even good because all the code could be within a function, as they represent a single thing.

```javascript
// square root of n with Newton-Raphson approximation
r = n / 2;
while ( abs( r - (n/r) ) > t ) {
  r = 0.5 * ( r + (n/r) );
}
System.out.println( "r = " + r );
```

This is the final result, detail no comments are needed.

```javascript
private double SquareRootApproximation(n) {
  r = n / 2;
  while ( abs( r - (n/r) ) > t ) {
    r = 0.5 * ( r + (n/r) );
  }
return r;
}
System.out.println( "r = " + SquareRootApproximation(r) );
```
