The og code.

The current code always return the HATEOAS links.

First, update the method signature that will grab the content of the accept header to determine the media type.

 Then, check which type of media type was inputted, to see if its valid. The correct namespace for this media type header value is `Microsoft.Net.Http.Headers`. This code supports a single media type, but if the request have several media types use the `TryParseList`.

The surround the hateoas return with an if based on the media type. If not, just return the authors.

# Testing
This request return a json with the accept header is and is not in the request body.

However.

No output formatter was register that handle that type.

# Adding a formatter.
Go to the helper extension. The og code.

ASP has a pipeline to add formatters. Inside of `AddControllers`, I can call `InputFormatters` and `OutputFormatters` to determine how inputs and responses are formatted. Then, chaining `AddNewtonsoftJson` adds that formatter to the `OutputFormatters` list after the initial configuration of the MVC `configure` meaning modifying `OutputFormatters` before calling `AddNewtonsoftJson`, make the `AddNewtonsoftJson` not available. 

To solve this, add the following configuration after `AddController` configuration. Calling configure on the services collection.

# Testing
Now works.
