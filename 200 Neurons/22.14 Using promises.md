# Using a promise
When a function returns a promise, then annotate it with `: Promise<data type>`. The data type is the type return when the promise resolve successfully. 

In this example, async functions take some time, so the code is using the set time out function. Then it call for a get titles function. If the array of found movies contains at least one element, call `resolve` if not, call `reject`. Finally, the promise object is return.

Having the promise function created, when invoked, I have to chain the then and catch functions, both take callbacks as parameters. Remember, then uses the data passed to the `resolve` function in the async function, `foundMovies` in this example.

# Chaining promises
When the `then` function has a return statement, that value becomes **the new** `resolve` value. This means, I can chain another `then` to manipulate again the new value.

In this example, `numOfMovies` has the value of  `titles.length`.

Detail the body of both `then` is executed, there are two console logs.

# Handling errors
Another way of handling errors is passing the `reason` as a second parameter for the `then` function. Doing this, the `catch` function is not going to be called, however, `catch` is not only meant to handle rejected promises but also to handle any errors thrown in any `then` function.
