[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

The ruby `Gemlfile` is a file where all dependencies are with its versions. Detail the file name doesn't end in `.rb` or something. It must be in the root folder of the project. 

## Bundler and how to create the Gemfile
Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed. Bundler by itself is a package that every Ruby installation comes with. 

### Creating the Gemfile

>To use and import a gem I have to first imported from the rubygems or any other third party website using `source 'https://rubygems.org'`, and then specify all the dependencies and its versions (not required) but for version management is **extremely important** to list the versions and commit the Gemfie to the repo.

I can use `'~> 2.2.4` to set the dependency to use a specific version or `'<2.2.4` that means use any other version prior to 2.2.4 excluding.

Once the Gemfile is create execute `bundler install` to install all the dependencies, that will produce  `Gemfile.lock` file with all the detail versions of the gems.
