[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

When multiple operators are use within an expression they are grouped by their precedence, if they have the same precedence, their associativity decides how they are grouped. [Here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.precedence.php) is a table that show operator precedence. 

The assignment operator has a very low precedence, thus, when a variable gets assigned an expressions, first the expression is evaluated and then the assignation occurs. So, higher precedence operators are executed first. 

Parenthesis have higher precedence so I can use it to get its content executed first. `$x = (2 + 5) * 7;//49 ` 
## Operator associativity
When operators have the same precedence, the associativity tells from where the code gets executed. `$x = $y = 5;` according to the table, = associativity is right, so the code gets executed from right to left. 

>[!example]
>According to the table, the / and * operator have the same precedence and its associativity is left, thus, the expression is evaluated from left to right; so division is executed first, and the result is multiplied by `%z`. 
>```PHP
>$x = 5;
>$y= 2;
>$z = 10;
>$result = $x / $y * $z;

### Operators with the same precedence
 Operator with non-associative properties can't be use next to each other; In this cases I can use an operator with a different precedence
 
>[!example]
>```PHP
>$x = 5;
>$y= 2;
>$z = 10;
>$result = $x < $y > $z; // Invalid as < and > have the same precedence
>$result = $x < $y == $z;// valid as < has higher precedence than == 

## Example
In this example, the `!` unary operator has higher precedence than `&&`, so `!$y` is evaluated first, and the result is evaluated to with `$x`. 
```php
$x = true;
$y = false;
var_dump($x && !$y); // bool(true)
```

In this other, the `&&` gets evaluated first, and the result is compared to `|| $z`. 
```php
$x = true;
$y = false;
$z = true;
var_dump($x && $y || $z); // bool(true)
```

## Use of parenthesis and using of `and` and `or`
>[!multi-column]
>
>`and` and `or` have the lowest precedence, even lower than =, that's why in this case, the result is true and `and $y` is not even executed.

That's why parenthesis is useful to:
- Make code more readable. 
- Dictates how I want to make the associativity work, instead of relaying on precedence.
