## What is whitespace?
Whitespace is any string composed of only spaces, tabs or line breaks
## HTML ignores whitespace?
Yes, it ignores any whitespaces and treat it as a single space. This include the space before and after the elements and within them. Whitespace don't impact the layout of a page. 

```HTML
<h1> This   is   a   test</h1>
<!-- This is a test -->
```
## Whitespace within the DOM
Any whitespace **_outside_** of HTML elements in the source code is represented in the DOM. **This is needed internally so that the editor can preserve formatting of documents.** This means:
- There will be some text nodes that contain only whitespace.
- Some text nodes will have whitespace at the beginning or end.
- Any line breaks used when creating an element and when it encloses it, will produce a text node (see second last example below).
- Multiple white spaces create only one text node, that can be filled with actual text. In this last case, no more text nodes will be created (see last example).
- An element can have only one whitespace-generated text node; unless it has a child, in which it can have one before and after its child. (last example)

### What whitespace is not represented in the DOM?
1. Between tags: `<div> Some text</div>` the space between the words won't create any text node.
2. Within tags: `<div   id="test">Some test</div>` same goes for space within a tag.
3. Within preformatted text: line breaks when using the `<pre>` tag.
4. Elements like `<img>`, `<input>` or `<br>` won't take place in the DOM tree. 

## Whitespace and text nodes
Some considerations are required to understand how text nodes are created between the major three HTML tags:

>[!multi-column]
>
>Any whitespace between `<!doctype html>`, `<html>` and `<head>` won't create any whitespace. 
>
>![[Pasted image 20240425092444.png|center|200]]

>[!multi-column]
>
>Because an element can have only one whitespace-generated text node; the `<html>` tag will always have his text node from the line break between `</head>` and `<body>`. 
>

>[!multi-column]
>
>Any line break after the `<body>` will create a the whitespace text node for the body tag. This line break includes any made after `<body>` or between `</body>` and `</html>`.

>[!multi-column]
>
>The head element has two text nodes, the first one for the line break after `<head>` and the last one for the line break after `</title>`

>[!multi-column]
>
>Detail no more text nodes are created after the storng element, as the rule says that only one child text node per element, so strong has one child text node, and p has two (because it has one child.)

>[!info]
>As seen in [[22.5 HTML souce code vs DOM#^1ced74|in this example]] the parsed code show in the inspector might be different from the source code. Have this in mind in case of a very unique bug and also to check how the DOM is chaining the HTML source code.

## What is NOT a text node?
The text of an HTML element. Detail after `<p>` are words, thus, there is not a text node there. However, at the after `<p>` element is a line break, so there is a text node between `<p>` and `<h2>`.
