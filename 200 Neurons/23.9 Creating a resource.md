[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

The model that receive the data don't have to the same when retrieving information from the API. 

Add a new class. There's no Id because that's the server responsibility, not the user one; but it depends. Regardless if the user have or not have to create an Id, is better to create a separate class model for post information to the API; also validation for input and output could be different.

>Use a separate Dto model class for creating, updating, and returning resources.

# Creating the action method
Then, modify the points of interest controller adding a new action to create a point of interest. Detail the template is using the city id parameter, therefore, the action method must provided that value.

>The above is not the best approach. 

To be able to get the content of the request message, I need to deserialize to a point of interest for creation dto, that's why I have that as a second parameter of the action method. I don't have to use any attribute, because the `[ApiController]` got [[23.9 Passing data to the API|that]].

Several things must eb checked with post request, for example, what if the consumer send a request that doesn't exists. Then I need to calculate the id, this example do that manually.

Then I have to make sure the data is mapped to the correspond model, in this case, point of interest dto, to make that I need to deserialize, creating a point of interest dto copying what ever is necessary. Then add the point of interest to the collection. To better understand, the request need to be deserialized to the model in charge of create the data, in this case, the point of interest for creation dto, thus, the instance need to have the same properties as that class has.

Then I need to return a response code using the created at route helper method that allows to return a response with a creation header that will contain the URI of the newly created point of interest can be found. The question is, where it can be found? In this example, in the get point of interest action method.
That's why I can name that action method like that.

Now the create at route need where the point of interest can be found (in the get point of interest action method) with their correspond parameters, that are a city id and a point of interest if, in this case, of the new point of interest.

`CreatedAtRoute(<action method where can I find the resource>, new created resource)`.

The newly created resource will end in the response body.

## Test in postman
To test, provide a body, with json for example, then indicate the content type header, and test. 

![[Pasted image 20250121110013.png]]

Once send, a 201 should be received.

Also, inspect the headers of the response, to see the location header. I also can test that.
