[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

Generic functions accept a type parameter that is ether specified or inferred every time the function is invoked.

In this example, the function accepts one type parameter, `T`, meaning, I can specify the type of T when invoking the function. Because the parameter type is `T`, that type should be use  elsewhere in the function. 

This function accept a parameter whose type will be specified by the type parameter T, therefore, the type of the parameter `thing` is T. This example also return the same type parameter, that's why the return value is annotated with T.

```ts
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
}

// Usage
let output1 = identity<string>("Hello"); // T is string
let output2 = identity<number>(42);     // T is number
let output3 = identity(true);           // T is inferred as boolean
```

Another example.

Detail when calling the function, the code needs to explicitly state the type of parameters my function is going to use for that invokation. Detail the function is expected the argument to be an array of movies, and the return type will be also an array of movies.

When invoking a function, the compiler will try its bets to infer the type of a function argument. Detail there's no error here. Detail the function signature is the same.

Here is the power of generics, I can use the same function with other type completely different.

>Additionally, I have to create a function that checks if an array is an array of strings or number. This makes things more difficult.
