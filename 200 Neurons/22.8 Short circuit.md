[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

## Short circuit
When a logical operator is getting determine, it will stops there and the rest of the code won't get executed. For example, when using `&&`, the operator needs to keep checking the rest of the operators to see if anyone is a true; with `||` it stops at the first true.  ^5b2340

```PHP
$x = true;
$y = false;
var_dump($x || $y);// true
```

This code stops when interpreted $x and $y never gets executed because the result of the logical operator was already determine, there is no need to execute $y.

Detail with `&&` both operators are executed and then the result of the logical operator is printed. 

>The `&&` operator have higher precedence than `||`. Because of that `$x && hello()` are group together and gets executed first, that result in false, and then gets executed `false || true`, that results true.

## Array operators
![[Pasted image 20240305152531.png|center|450]]

### Union
Union takes the the two arrays and append keys that are unique. If the keys are the same, the result will use the keys of the first array.

Here the only different index is the last one, so the result array is the first two elements of the first array and the last element of the second array. 
```PHP
$a = array("a" => "apple", "b" => "banana");
$b = array("a" => "pear", "b" => "strawberry", "c" => "cherry");
$c = $a + $b; // Union of $a and $b
print_r($c);// Array ( [a]=> apple [b]=> banana [c]=> cherry )
```
### Comparison and strict comparison
Comparison return true if both arrays have the same key/value pairs. If only one pair is different, then it return false. String comparison will take into account the data types and even the order of the key/pair values, if only one pair is in different order, then it return false.
