[[12.6 Git and Github|Git and Github]]

>[!warning] Git commands are context based
>All Git commands have different outputs based on which directory is my current working directory. For example, if my project have two folders one and two, and my cwd is two, executing `git add .` stage the current folder recursively but one. This is different from executing `git add -A` in two, which will stage everything!
