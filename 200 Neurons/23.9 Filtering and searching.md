# About filtering and searching
Filtering pass the field name and value via query string. Filtering is precise by adding filters. Filtering allow filtering only fields that are part of the resource, meaning if the resource has a Name field, filtering is possible with Name, but not with FirstName or LastName that are not part of the resource, those are part of the underlying entity and that's not important for REST.

Searching pass text to search for via query string. In this case the search query is `searchQuery`

In this example, the API should return all resources that have pirate as part of, for example, any string field. Searching is wider

- Both filtering and searching are not part of the resource.

- Allow the consumer to pass in a value via query string. If I prefer (for readability), add the from query attribute, but in this case is not require because the parameter is not a complex type nor a form file or collection. Detail the query stirng type is nullable, this allow the consumers to get authors without passing the main category. 

Now, the get authors async doesn't support the main category filter, so add one, on the course library repo

Then implemented. Check if the category is null or whitespace, if is, return all authors by calling the method. Then, trim the main category, then apply the filter using where clauses.

Then call the method from the controller

# Testing
Two authors are getting back.
