## File system
Part of the operating system that manages and organizes files and directories. 

>[!info] Current working directory
> Almost every time  the shell is being used, it works within the `current working directory`. Commands read, copy and manipulate files based in this location. To know where I'm at, use the `pwd` (print working directory) command.
### File system organization 
A common file system looks like an upside down three. The top most directory, refer with `/`, is the `root directory` that holds everything.

>Detail the `/` is the leading character shown in the home directory [[23.4 Navigating files and directories#Identifying the home directory|here.]] So, the current work directory is inside `/home/pjbernal` and `/home` is inside the root because it starts with `/`
>>[!warning]
>>`/` has two meanings:
>> - If it appears at the front of a file or directory, it refers to the root directory.
>> - If it appears inside a path, it's just a separator

The home directory depends of the user is utilizing the shell. In this image are three possible home directories. Typically, when the command prompt is open, the cwd will be the home directory. 

#### Identifying the home directory
The image shows the home directory (`/home/pjbernal`) If something else is printed, use the `cd` command to fall back directories to find the home directory.

>Root directory is what holds everything the computer use to function (bin, data, users, tem directories). The home directory is user dependent and holds user's directories and files. They are not the same. 
### ls
(Stands for listing) Prints the names of files and directories in the cwd or a given location.  

![[Pasted image 20231108133536 1.png|center|450]]

>The `-F` option tells `ls` to classify the directory content, adding a marker to files and directories (/ indicates directory, @ indicates link, * indicates executable), names without a marked are files in the `cwd`. The next image show only sub-directories.

>Also [[23.4 Working With Files and Directories#^e5e469|this]] is how I can review all the subdirectories within a directoy.
>Also it can be use to check if a one or more files or subdirectories are present within the cwd `ls file_name.txt subdirectory/file_name.txt` 

>`ls -lash` will show me the exact file size in Kb. 
### Clear
Clear the command terminal, but let me access previous commands with the arrow keys. 

## Getting built in help
Some commands are built in to the Bash shell (`cd` command), rather than existing as separate programs on the file system. Thus, to check command capabilities, in some cases, only one of the following options might work.
### --help option
Option supported by most bash commands and programs. 

![[Pasted image 20231122130507 1.png|center|350]]

### --man command
Command that turn the terminal into a page with a description (more than --help) of the command and its options. To navigate through the `man` pages:
- Use up and down arrow keys.
- B and spacebar to move a full page. 
- / followed by the character or work to search for, and N or shift + N to move between results. 
- Q to quite the `man` pages. 


## Nesting options
>ls command has two options -t and -r. So either `ls -r -t` or `ls -rt` is valid. 
## Exploring directories
Use the ls command with any argument representing a sub-directory within cwd or path.

>[!warning] Linux desktop
>In Linux, the Desktop is a directory within the home directory. Differently in Windows that is the 'main screen'.
>![[Pasted image 20231108170307 1.png|center|300]]
>
>This is why `ls` only list one directory (that end with `/`) and one file; not the trash can and the home directory, the shell directory and the shell file. 
>>On most Linux systems, the contents of the `Desktop` directory will show up as icons in a GUI behind the open window, like in this case. 
>
>This is another example in which the argument is a path
`ls -F directory/sub-directory
`
![[Pasted image 20231108173606 1.png|center|300]]

>[!warning]
>On the previous example the cwd HAS NOT changed, the cwd is still in the home directory. 

>[!example]- looking directories locating outside the cwd
>Without changing the cwd I can review the content of other directories. The first case I fall back one directory, the second example I fall back two directories. 
>![[Pasted image 20231122164910 1.png|center|350]]
>Also, absolute paths can be use with ls. 
### See others directories content vs cwd content
As `-F` is a `ls` option, the command to see the cwd content is `ls -F`

>[!warning]

>![[Pasted image 20231108181035 1.png|center]]
>
>Having the cwd the home directory:
> - First command: see other's directories content without changing cwd.
> - Second command: see current's directory content without changing cwd.
> - Third command: see the current's directory content having changed the cwd. 
## Changing directory
`cd` (change directory) change the cwd and the shell's settings for what sub-directory or path is pass as an argument; if no argument is passed, the cwd is moved to the home directory per default. I can move only 'one directory level' per command. (Some commands (like `cd`) don't print anything when the commands gets executed, that's normal.)

>[!example] from the home directory to the excercise-data directory
>Detail how using the `pwd` show the cwd that is not any longer the home directory. 
>![[Pasted image 20231122155753 1.png|center|400]]

>[!warning] cd can't go one folder up the three
I can't use `cd` to fall back one directory. Using cd will retrieve to sub-directories or the shell  home directory.
>![[Pasted image 20231122141313 1.png|center|280]]
### Go one directory up
`..` is a special directory named 'the parent of the current folder' that fall back one directory the cwd. Using `..` tells the command move one folder up in the three and then do your thing ([[23.4 Working With Files and Directories#^a38566|see this]]).
![[Pasted image 20231122142640 1.png|center|300]]

`-a` option (show all hidden commands) shows the parent directory and 'the current working directory' `.`
![[Pasted image 20231122154902 1.png|center|300]]

>[!examples]- 
>- `cd .` does nothing as the cwd is not moved. 
>- `cd /` move the cwd to the root directory (not the home directory).
>![[Pasted image 20231122164117 1.png|center|130]]

Use of `.` prevent clutter the terminal with files and directories used that configure computer programs when the ls command is used.

>[!example] . files and directories within the home directory
>![[Pasted image 20231122155459 1.png|center|300]]
>The home directory includes files and sub-directories, but ls only shows the ones without .

## Relative vs absolute paths
### Relative paths
When a command tries to find a location using as a starting point the cwd. All the examples above are using relative paths.

### Absolute paths
When the command sets the cwd to any directory using the entire path (that starts with `/`) from the root directory. 

![[Pasted image 20231122161103 1.png|center|400]]
Absolute paths granted full movement (back and forward) between the cwd to any directory. The first command cwd is the home directory, after that is the exercise-data directory. 

## Movement shortcuts
- ~: is equivalent to the home directory absolute path for the shell, only if ~ is the first character in the path. 

![[Pasted image 20231122161756 1.png|center|400]]

- `-` Move the cwd to the previous working directory. The difference between `cd ..` and `cd -` is that the former brings you _up_, while the latter brings you _back_ (if I was on desktop and the move to one images directory using a absolute path, - will return me to Desktop, .. will fall me back to the images directory).
