# Send the status with JsonResult
Status codes can be send using `JsonResult`, but that's not the best practice, is better to use the action result class.

# Send the status with the ControllerBase
## About `<ActionResult<T>>`
The `ControllerBase` class have helper methods that all create an `IActionResult`. Within the controller base definition are a b unch of `<what ever name>Result` methods, that most of them implement action result.

Now, the action method need to return the type the api consumer request, in this case, the `CityDto` class model. Then, if my method implementation want to use any of the controller base methods like `NotFound()`, to return a status code, or anything else, that method need to return an `ActionResult` type. 

Also, returning an action result type allows to explicit state return the type of request send, also the return type will be clearly documented in swagger. In the Original class, the code hard-coded `JsonResult`, but is more legible to state an `ActionResult<T>`, where T is what the api consumer is requesting.

In the case of returning all the cities, there is not 'not found' in this case, because even if nothing is found, that is a valid response in this case.

## About `<IActionResult<T>>`
This interface represents the result of an action method providing flexibility because it can return **multiple** type of HTTP responses, without being tied to a single return type.
