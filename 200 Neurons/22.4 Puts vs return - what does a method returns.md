## What does a method return
>In Ruby, a method always return exactly one single thing (an object). `nil` is still an object, and array returning several things, is still one single object. 

If that method is a loop, it will return something in **each iteration**, that will be an array.

## The return keyword
Ruby has an implicit return for methods (so the return statement is not mandatory), that means, **Ruby always will return something** the last executed line of code (not the last line of code) that was evaluated even without the return keyword (so return is not required), or the first hardcoded return statement if present. 

This is an example that the methods returns the last evaluated expression, not the last line of code. 
```ruby
def even_odd(number)
  if number % 2 == 0
    "That is an even number."
  else
    "That is an odd number."
  end
end

puts even_odd(16) #=>  That is an even number.
puts even_odd(17) #=>  That is an odd number.
```

>[!example] Using explicit return for checking input errors 
>When using return, I'm telling Ruby "This is the last expression you should evaluate"
>```ruby
>def even_odd(number)
>  unless number.is_a? Numeric
>    return "A number was not entered."
>  end
>
>  if number % 2 == 0
>    "That is an even number."
>  else
>    "That is an odd number."
>  end
>end
>
>puts even_odd(20) #=>  That is an even number.
>puts even_odd("Ruby") #=>  A number was not entered.
>

### Assigning a method = assigning the method return
Detail the `returned_value` gets assigned what the method returns, in this case 7.
```ruby
def add_three(number)
  number + 3
end

returned_value = add_three(4)
puts returned_value
#=> 7
```
## Puts

![[22.4 puts vs p vs print vs pp#Puts]]

## Examples

This methods doesn't return a value, but shows the value in the console. So `x = puts_squared(4)` prints 16 in the console, but the return value will be nil. Therefore, x will be assigned with nil. 

```ruby
def puts_squared(number)
  puts number * number
end

x = puts_squared(4) #=>16
puts x.class        #=> NilClass

y = x + 2  #=> Creates an error "undefined method `+' for nil:NilClass"
puts y
```

This code instead use the implicit return, so it doesn't shows any in the console, but return the value `number * number`. Because a value is being return I can then assigned it to a variable for further use. 

```ruby
def return_squared(number)
  number * number
end

x = return_squared(20) #=> 400
puts x.class   #=> Integer
y = 100
sum = x + y #=> 500

puts "The sum of #{x} and #{y} is #{sum}."
#=> The sum of 400 and 100 is 500.
```
