[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

Floats are numbers, typically, with decimal numbers. They could be represented in exponential form `$x = 13.5e3; echo $x;// 135000` or `$x = 13.5e-3; echo $x;//0.0135`

>[!important]
>Detail the first case the number don’t have any decimals, in theory is an integer, but the assignation includes a `.`, so is float. `$var = 13_000.5e3; var_dump($x);// float(13000500).`
## Limited precision
Binary is used internally to store floating numbers and some of them don’t have an exact representation in binary. Therefore, PHP will try to convert it to binary loosing some precision. Thus, some exact errors could appear.

>[!example]
For example, when using the floor function that returns the next lowest integer value (as float) by rounding down the number. 
>```PHP
>$x = floor((0.1 + 0.7) * 10; //It should return 0.8
>echo $x;// 7 // it get's rounded from 7.9 to 
>$x = ceil((0.1 + 0.3) * 10; // It should return 0.4
>echo $x;// 4 // it get's rounded from 3.999 to 4
>//In this case, 0.1 + 0.7 results in 7.999999, then it gets rounded down to 7. 

>Floor round a value to the lowest integer. Ceil rounds up. 
## Never compare floats directly
[question:: How to compare float results then]
Because of the limited precision, floats must not be compared directly. 

```PHP
$x = 0.23;
$y = 1 – 0.77
If ($x == $y){
    echo “yes”;
} else {
    echo “no”;
}
// no
Var_dump($x, $y);// float(0.23) float(0.23)
```

Even utilizing the strict equality === it will return no. 
## NaN
When a operation can’t be computed, it will print NaN. `echo log(-1); //NaN`

## Check if a variable is NaN or INF or either an integer or float 
Use the `is_nan()`, `is_infinitie()` or `is_finite()`. This will return true or false. 
## Type casting 
Type casting can be done with (float), `$x = (float)5;`. If a plain string is converted to float, it will be coerced to float with a value of zero `$x= (float)'hi'; var_dump($x); //float(0)` on the other hand, and integer string can be coerced as expected `$x= (float)'3.5'; var_dump($x); //float(3.5)`.
