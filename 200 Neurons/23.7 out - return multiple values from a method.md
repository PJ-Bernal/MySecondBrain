[[13.7 C Sharp|C#]]

Use when passing values by reference. `out` refences don't need to be declared (but initialized), however, before the method ends, the out reference parameter must be initialized.

Because `out` is being use in reference values, this means the original value can be change from within the method. 

By default, a method can return a single value, however, `out` allows to return multiple values.
