## Installing a package
As an example, I'll install a package to work with unique identifiers call uuid. 

![[Pasted image 20240313104545.png]]

In this case, the package name is uuid, and the vendor name is ramsey.

Then, **within the container** execute `composer require vendor/package`.

Once the command is executed, the composer will install that package and other packages the main package depends on.
