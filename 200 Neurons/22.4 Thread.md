[[13.4 Linux]]


## Thread
Branching out of a process, when they made more than one unit of work concurrently. Threads also are lightweight, they can spawn quickly. Two more columns are important here: LWP (Unique thread identifier inside a process, which stands for light weight process) and NLWP (Number of threads for a given process).

NWLP indicates single or multi-thread processes. For example, in processes 2 to 14 a single thread, 609 branches out in two and 709 branches out in four. 

For single-thread processes, the LWP and PID are the same. In multi-thread processes, only one value of the LWP matches its PID. Also, a value assigned to a LWP is never given to another process. 

### Single-thread process
Because the process and the thread are the same, only one thing is happening, they share the same memory and resources.

### Multi-thread process
In this scenario, the thread shares the same namespace as the process, and one stack of memory.  Thus, spawning a new thread within the process is cheap (in terms of system resources vs starting a new process) and switching is faster (they all share the same namespace).
