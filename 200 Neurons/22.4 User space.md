[[13.4 Linux]]

Memory area where non-kernel applications (programs executed by the user) run in its own dedicated memory space; some might be executed by an init system (systemd).

All the user space process runs in user mode with no high privileges. But, when the process requires a service from the kernel, it has to switch to kernel mode using a system call.
