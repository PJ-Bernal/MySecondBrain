[[12.2 The internet|The internet]]
## What is an HTTP method?
Or HTTP Request Method; verb that <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">tells the server</mark> what <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">action</mark> to perform on a resource (every method is a request, so [[22.2 HTTP requests#^35eeef|remember this]]). The most common are GET and POST. ^11ff20

### CORS safe methds
Any request made aside of the GET, HEAD or POST is consider unsafe. 
## GET request
<mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">Request</mark> initiated by any interaction from the user with the server (e.g. typing an address in the browser) to <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">retrieve a needed resource</mark>. This method typically sent data as query parameters in the URL. 

>[!example]- GET request with Linux
>`$ curl -X GET "https://www.reddit.com/" -m 30 -v`
>
>Or sending a query:
>
>`$ curl -X GET "https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=Michael%20Jackson" -m 30 -v`

The response from a GET (see [[22.2 HTTP requests#^bfe81b|how it looks like]]) request can be anything, but if it's HTML that reference other resources, the browser will automatically request those referenced resources. A pure HTTP tool will not. ^34db81

Remember the [[22.2 What is a URL#Queries limitations|query limitations]] as GET works a lot with URL and queries in general. 
## POST request
>Request to initiate some action on the server or send data to it, generally a form. This request allow to send larger information (images and videos) and sensitive data to the server, throughout the request body and not the URL. 

>[!tip] Sending sensitive information
>The flaw of creating a `GET` request to send sensitive information through a query string, relies on the fact the string will be visible on the URL (remember [[22.2 What is a URL#^1d1398|queries pairs are visible on the URL]])
>
>This is solved utilizing `POST` on a form which additionally, sidestep of the query string size limitation `GET` have. 

>[!example]- Linux `POST` request vs browser `POST` request
>With the browser, a POST request could be filling a form and be redirected to another page, something line this:

>With Linux, the next <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">command</mark> line has the <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">same effect as filling a form</mark>: `curl -X POST "http://al-blackjack.herokuapp.com/new_player" -d "player_name=Albert" -m 30 -v`. The [[22.2 What is a URL#URL components|host and path]] and the parameter to be 'posted' are needed.

>Detail the command is referencing the `name` of the `input` tag to send the information.

### How the data is being submitted to the server?
>Data is being send in the HTTP body. The specific content and format of the HTTP body are determined by the "Content-Type" header (e.g. HTML, JSON, form data, file upload, etc.), that is processed by the server who expects data in the same format (if the "Content-Type" is "application/json," the server expects the data to be in JSON format.)
### POST raw response (Why the browser redirect the client after filling a form?)
Within the response headers is located the `Location` header the browser interprets and automatically issues a brand new request to that URL (that's why as the client filled the form is  [[22.2 HTTP request methods#^959d54|redirected.]] This is a clear example of a [[22.2 Understanding responses#302 Found|302 found response]] ^d00e12

Linux command line has the same effect as filling a form and a raw response may look like this, but won't issue the automatically second request (some HTTP tools do that).

## Understanding the Linux request command line
Breaking apart the post command line:
- curl: tool for transferring data with URLs, often used to make HTTP requests.
- -X POST: specified the request method, POST in this case.
- `"http://al-blackjack.herokuapp.com/new_player"` the URL (host and path) to which the POST request will be sent. 
- `-d`: allow to include specific data in the request body when making a POST request using curl command typically in a key-value format; In the example 'player_name=Albert'. 
- `-m`: specifies the maximum time in second the request is allow before being aborted.	
- `-v`: stands for 'verbose' and makes `curl` provided detailed information (headers and other information useful for debugging and seeing what is happening during the request) about the request and response.

## Questions
[question:: how to send information to the server utilizing a GET method]
[question:: GET method is the only method that uses the URL to send or retrieves information]
[question:: what is the HTTP body]
[question:: what is an HTTP message and what does it mean is optional]
[question:: how the message is send using the body, like, really how]
[question:: how the headers work. Several things are being requests, but how... ]
[question:: what is the difference between a response or a request header]
