Member data allows to share data across multiple tests of the same class.

 For example, this tests test almost the same, only use True and another False.

# Create the theory
In the class for dd test, create a method for this test.

The error is because theory needs data, and there's nothing there yet.

Example with inline data

# Using member data
Member data can use a property or method to pass data over multiple methods in the same class or even different classes 

## using a property
The property member needs to return an `IEnumerable` and be static. When using the property, use `nameof`.

## Using a method

When using a method, I can pass a parameter to indicate which data to pass.

![[Pasted image 20250303115051.png]]

in this case, only the first test case, the {100, true} is going to be pass to the theory. Detail only one test occur.

![[Pasted image 20250303115152.png]]

If no parameter is pass, all test cases are going to be passed to the theory.

# Share test data over multiple methods from different  classes
In this case I need to provide the Member Type parameter to the member data attribute and pass the method that holds the test cases.

However, is better to use class data to share test cases across multiple classes.
