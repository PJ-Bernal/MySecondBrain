[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

The stack trace prints each line of code in your program that was executed before it crashed. But, the very first line is what provides more useful information (`bottles.rb...`).

This is a more clear example of how to read the stack trace, detail the bottom method is the first called in the stack and the first line of the error is the last method executed.

```ruby
def method1
  method2
end
def method2
  puts invalid_variable
end
method1
```

```ruby
/tmp/stack.rb:6:in 'method2': undefined local variable or method 'invalid_variable' for main:Object (NameError)
    from /tmp/stack.rb:2:in 'method1'
    from /tmp/stack.rb:9:in '<main>'
</main>
```

## Interpreting the stack line by line
The first line tells the line where the error was found, but not necessarily when the error was generated.

### Another example
Here is more clear the stack should be read, first the first line, then from bottom to top, right to left.

```ruby
def space_out_letters(person)
  return person.split("").join(" ")
end

def greet(person)
  return "H e l l o, " + space_out_letters(person)
end

def decorate_greeting(person)
  puts "" + greet(person) + ""
end

decorate_greeting("John")
decorate_greeting(1)
```

```ruby
H e l l o, J o h n
greeting.rb:2:in `space_out_letters': undefined method `split' for 1:Integer (NoMethodError)
from greeting.rb:6:in `greet' from greeting.rb:10:in `decorate_greeting'
from greeting.rb:14:in `<main>'
```


## How to deal with the stack trace
1. Read the top line of the stack trace.
2. If the file is part of your project: open the faulting file on the indicated line number. If it isnâ€™t, keep going down the stack trace until you find the first reference to a file you recognize.
3. Start debugging.
