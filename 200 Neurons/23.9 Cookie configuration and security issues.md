Whether a cookie is send by the browser depends on:
- Domain. 
- The `SameSite` mode. Just use https schema. 
- whether or not the domain attribute was set when the cookie was initially sent to the browser in the response.
# About the domain
If the domain attribute is not set, the cookie is set for the parent domain, but not for a different subdomain. The port doesn't matter.

If the attribute is set, cookies could be sent to different subdomains.

.NET middleware doesn't set the domain attribute by default, but it can be override using the options object inside `.AddCookie()`. The default, without configuring, is more secure.

# XSS
Attacker inject malicious scripts into webpages, which can steal cookies. To mitigate this, use a content security policy to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded. 
# Http only flag
Also the `HttpOlny` flag, if true, the cookie can only be accessed by the server via http request. Meaning, JS can't access the cookie. 
# Defense in depth
With the CSP and the only flag the cookie can't be stolen. The defense in depth encourage to use both ways of mitigation. 
# Ensuring cookie is serve only over https
HTTPs ensures the cookie can't be intercepted while in transit, do that through the secure policy always.

# CSRF
An attack where a malicious site tricks a user browser into making unwanted request to a different site where the user is authenticated. 

To avoid that implement the .NET core anti-forgery toke that ensure the request is coming from the authenticated user and not from a malicious site. Apply the `ValidateAntiForgeryToken` on the controller actions that handle state changing request like post, put, patch, delete. 

Also same site into strict will help to mitigate this.
