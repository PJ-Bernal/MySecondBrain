# About metadata
Some useful metadata could be: total amount of return items, pages, current page number, etc. Is included in the response body via a metadata/paging field. 

This example shows how metadata can be send, however, this is not the best practice. The consumer should receive a paged JSON (or any other data structure), but the image shows an envelop that includes results and metadata fields, and this is NOT a JSON representation of the requested collection (cities collection in this case), but a representation of a resource that represents cities and paging metadata.

Paging information is not part of the resource representation, but metadata related to that resource, that should be in the response header, so the consumer can parse that to get information. 
## Where to put the metadata
Place metadata in a custom pagination header on the response, like `X-Pagination`. 
# Adding the metadata
## Construct the metadata
Create a class in the services folder. Create any kind of properties I consider essential to show when the consumer make a request; this is useful when the repo method includes pagination; showing metadata when requesting a single resource is not that essential.

## Build the metadata
### Changing the method signature
Change the method signature to a tuple (allows to return multiple types), adding `, PaginationMetadata`.

### Updating the interface

### Creating the implementation
After all where clauses are written, execute statements calling the `CountAsync` method to call the db to get the total amount of items. Then use the pagination metadata class.

Add the total item count and pagination metadata.

Then create a collection, and return the collection and the metadata.

### Updating the controller
#### Adding the tuple
The get cities async returns a tuple, therefore, the variable that holds its return value must have the same return type, so add a tuple there.

#### Adding the pagination metadata header

# Testing
The response is ok
