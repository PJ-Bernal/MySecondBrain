[[13.6 SQL]]

## Connect Table Plus with my db 
Useful for prototyping, and small projects, but never use for production.

## Create a table / commit changes
Within TP, right click on the left side new table.  First I will create the columns, its data types, etc. Every change to the db is represented in a SQL query that must be committed, either with `ctrl + S` or clicking above. Uncommitted changes appear in color, green in this case.

Once I commit the changes, I won't have any sql statements available and the interface will update.
