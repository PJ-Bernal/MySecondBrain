>Remember the `*` has a very low specificity so almost all reset rules can be easily overwriten. 

## Box-sizing: border-box
This snippet grants the width percentages set to any content box resolve based on the border-box. **Present on normalize**
```css
*, *::before, *::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

>[!multi-column]

>%% %%
>Now detail how with border-box the content box adjust to its border.

![[Pasted image 20240612162741.png]]
In this case, the content box will occupy the 100% of its border, minus 40px of padding and 4px of border, so from 244px using content-box, it will shrink to 156px. 

## line-heigh: 1,5
Makes the vertical spacing between each text line ease readability. However, using this with headings produce an exaggerate spacing; mainly because the line-height value is a fix number. **Not resent on normalize**.
```css
:root {
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

In this example, the header line-height is 5.5.

>Remember line-height multiply its value by the font-family size, either specified or browser user-agent. So, to change this behavior I can use `line-height: calc(1em + 0.5rem);` that tells the browser, not multiply but add 0,5rem to whatever value of font-family is set.

In this case, the paragraph is not being affected because I'm not specifying any font-family, so its line-height is 1,5 still. However, the paragraph line-height is 4.5rem and is looking better than the above image.

## -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased
MacOS used in the past the subpixel antialiasing, however in 2018 they turn it off, but Chrome and other browser still used it by default, that's why this snippet comes in handy; [here](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/#four-font-smoothing-5) I can check a visual difference of antialiasing vs subpixel antialiasing.  **Not present in normalization**.

```css
body {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}
```

- Typically, media are set to be inline, but typically they should be used as any other layout element, this is as blocks. Using any inline elements in any layout will produce strange outcome. So adding `display:block;` to all images as `max-width:100%;` to avoid overflowing. 

Most block-level elements will automatically grow/shrink to fit their parent, but media elements like <img> are special: they're known as replaced elements, and they don't follow the same rules.If an image has a "native" size of 800Ã—600, the <img> element will also be 800px wide, even if we plop it into a 500px-wide parent.

## Media default of display:block and max-width: 100%
By default images are treat as 'inline' elements, but is better to treat them as layout elements (blocks). Using an inline element will create a 4px gap that's not margin, padding or border; this is solve creating a display block. And to prevent image overflowing use max-width: 100%. 

```css
img, picture, video, canvas, svg {
  display: block;
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

>[!important]
>Most block-level elements will automatically grow/shrink to fit their parent, but media elements like `<img>` are special: they're known as replaced elements, and they don't follow the same rules.

## Inherit fonts for form controls
```css
input, button, textarea, select {
  font: inherit; /*Needs to be 16 px at least*/
}
```

By default, buttons and inputs don't inherit styles from their parents. For example, `<textarea>` use a default 13px font-size causing the browser in mobile to zoom in, provide an undesired experience. [This video](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/images/custom-css-reset/safari-zoom.mp4) shows this effect.

To avoid this zoom in, the inputs need to have a font size of at least 1rem/16px. 

## Word wrapping
```css
p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
}
```

>[!multi-column]
