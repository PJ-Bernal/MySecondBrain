[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

An AR class inherits all the AR methods to be used as class-level methods, therefore, within a model I can use any method with no dot notation. This methods 'affect' symbols, that are used a simple identifiers and are more efficient than strings.

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :category
end
```

Within this class, `belongs_to` is a class method of AR, and `:category` is a symbol that act as an identifier. The same happens when a method call , require arguments. In this example `uniqueness` and `true` both are symbols, that in reality conform a hash key/value pair: `{:uniqueness => :true}` However, for simplicity, the hash is not required leaving `:uniqueness: true`. 

>[!important]
>If the value is a string or a boolean I can omit the colon from the value, if not is required.
>```ruby
>class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_uniqueness_of :user_name, scope: :account_id
  validates :email, uniquenes: true
end
>```
>The same happens with method arguments in the script:
>```ruby
>customer = Customer.where({:city => 'Winnipeg'})
>customer = Customer.where(city: 'Winnipeg')
>```

Outside of the model, methods must use the classic dot notation to perform actions:

```ruby
category = Category.find(1)

# Create a new product associated with this category
product = Product.create(name: "Sample Product", category: category)
```
