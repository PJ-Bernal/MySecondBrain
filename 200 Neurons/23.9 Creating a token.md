# Creating the controller and endpoint to generate the token
Right click on the controllers folder -> add -> controller -> empty. Then, in routing, is no a good practice to use the `[controller]` is better to be specific. 

![[Pasted image 20250128082039.png]]

So change the controller and add one action.

![[Pasted image 20250128082148.png|center|450]]

## Adding an action method
The return type is a string, because the token is a string, and the http method is post. 

![[Pasted image 20250128082359.png|center|350]]

## Creating a class to manipulate the username and pass
Create a class to manipulate both. That class shouldn't be use outside of the controller. It can be in a separate file, be scoped to that controller namespace or hard-coded inside of the class. 

in the image is hard coded inside of the same class.

## Adding authenticate implementation
### Adding parameters
The authenticate method use a class instance as a parameter, that will be automatically deserialized from the request body as a class is a complex object.

### Validate credentials with a hard-coded method
![[Pasted image 20250128083119.png|center]]
#### Method implementation
The return type of this method should be the type api consumer user, hence, create a user class that is not going to be used outside of the authentication controller class. 

---
##### Create user class
Detail all properties are about the user only. 

![[Pasted image 20250128083356.png]]

---
Use that type as the return type for the method.

![[Pasted image 20250128083557.png]]

In real life the credentials are within in a table within a db. This code assumes the credentials are valid and return a user. 
![[Pasted image 20250128084154.png]]

>In real likfe I have to check the passed username and password against what is stored in the db. 

### If the user is not valid
Return unauthorized

![[Pasted image 20250128084310.png|center|350]]

### Create a secret
Tokens are signed, meaning, they need a key that is created using a secret. Store those in a safe place when in production (key vault from azure).

For developing purposes I can store that in app settings file.

The secretforkey will generate the signing key. Issuer creates the token in my case is the API, and audience which is the entity for whom token is intended to be consumed (this string could be anything).

![[Pasted image 20250128084515.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250225090348.png|center]]
### Inject configuration object to be able to use the app settings json in the method implementation
A configuration object is require, do that using constructor injection.

![[Pasted image 20250128084829.png]]

### Create the token
#### Creating the symmetric security 
First, use the secret to create the key creating an instance of the symmetric secutiry key passing the secret as a byte array.  

![[Pasted image 20250128085021.png]]

#### Creating the credentials
I don't have the signing credentials yet, that are the credentials used for signing the token. To do that ue the signing credentials method passing the security key and an algorithm, the hmacsha256 is a standard. 

![[Pasted image 20250128085258.png]]

#### Create the claims
A token can contain key-value information about the user, called claims, in this context, a claim is the identity-related information of the user. 

![[Pasted image 20250128085448.png]]

Keys could have any name but they follow certain standards:
- Sub: standardized  key for the unique user identifier. 
- given_name: represents the first name.
- family_name: represents the last name. 
#### Create the token
Create a Jwt secutiry token instance. first pass the issuer and audience values, then the claims, then a date time to indicate the start of the token validity (before that time the token can't be used and validation will fail), second date time indicate the end of token validity.

![[Pasted image 20250128090027.png]]

Finally, serialize the Jwt secutiry toke into a string representation and return it. The write token method takes the JWT object and converts it into a compact string representation.

![[Pasted image 20250128090455.png]]

# Testing
Use this body to test the token
![[Pasted image 20250128090552.png]]

After send. 200 and the token

![[Pasted image 20250128090606.png]]

Then copy the token and fo to jwt.io and paste it.

![[Pasted image 20250128090634.png]]

Detail the nbf, not before, and exp, expires on, represents the validity time of the token in seconds passed since 1970 in unix format. 

>[!important]
>Detail I only hard-coded 4 claims, the other claims like nbf, exp, iss, and aud are standard claims that are automatically generated to the JWT by a token generation process.

# Another example of creating a token
The token secret is the most important thing. Store that securely.

![[Pasted image 20250225083310.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250225083400.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250225083419.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250225083433.png]]

Now, analyze this, the first implementation doesn't pass any custom claims, but the token return some custom claims like the city, given and family name.

However, with this implementation, I need to pass the custom claims to the body. This implementation allows to send any kind of custom claims. 

![[Pasted image 20250225084226.png]]

once the token is parsed, the custom claims are there. I have to pass the secret to make the signature correct.
