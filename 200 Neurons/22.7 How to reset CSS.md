[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

My CSS rules have higher precedence than the user-agent rules, they overwrite the defaults. However, to have a fresh and clean CSS is common to use some CSS resets, that are stylesheets that contain CSS rules aim to altering or remove the default styles set by user-agents stylesheets. 

This reset is not mandatory, and some people don't even use them, or just use their own resets.
