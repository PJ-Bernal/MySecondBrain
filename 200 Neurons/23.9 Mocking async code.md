This is the same test of the last note, but imagine is an async test.

in this example the fetch internal employee async method will be used in the test. The test is using the get internal employee that use the fetch internal employee method, for this example, the get internal employee method will invoke the fetch internal employee async.

So invoke that method and add await, also add task and async on the test signature. When using an async method in the set up, I need to Returns Async.
