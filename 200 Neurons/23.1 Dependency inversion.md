[[13.1 OO Programming|OOP]]

 High level modules should never depend on low level modules, Both should depend on abstractions. We should decouple high-level modules from low-level modules by introducing an abstraction layer between them. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oHY5TllWaU&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH9kocFX7R7BAe_CvvOCO_p9&index=5&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) to check a code example. 

>[!info] About high and low lever modules
>High level modules deal with more abstract operations, they often use other modules to achieve something complex. They're closer to the end-user's needs and are less likely to change due to technical details. 
>
>Low lever modules deal with more specific request and provide the system with fundamental tasks. They're closer to the hardware system. 

>[!important]
>This abstraction or 'interface' doesn't depend on anything, neither the higher or low level modules. 
>My code should depend on interfaces, abstraction, instead of external dependencies implementation. 

This example violates the principle because `UserService` is tightly coupled to `UserService`, so if I want to change the database to PostgreSQL for example I will have to modify `UserService`.

```js
class MySQLDatabase {
  connect() {
    console.log('Connecting to MySQL database');
  }
  
  query(sql) {
    console.log(`Executing SQL query: ${sql}`);
  }
}

class UserService {
  constructor() {
    this.database = new MySQLDatabase();
  }
  
  getUser(id) {
    this.database.connect();
    this.database.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`);
  }
}

const userService = new UserService();
userService.getUser(1);
```

To solve this, I need to think in terms of 'which layer can connect both modules' and 'what my high level module needs to do' to decouple them. So the first question is, how to connect? With a database class, what my high end module needs to do? Connect and do a query. 

This layer, `Database` will be an [[22.8 Abstract classes|abstract class]] that defines the interface for `MySQLDataBase` and `PostgreSQLDatabase` to implement. 

Detail now, `UserService` now depends on the abstraction `Database` rather than a direct implementation. Also detail I inject the database dependency into UserService through its constructor, so I can change between database implementations without change the `UserService` implementation. 

At the end, both modules depend on the `Database` abstraction. 

```js
// Abstraction
class Database {
  connect() {
    throw new Error('Connect method must be implemented');
  }
  
  query(sql) {
    throw new Error('Query method must be implemented');
  }
}

// Low-level module
class MySQLDatabase extends Database {
  connect() {
    console.log('Connecting to MySQL database');
  }
  
  query(sql) {
    console.log(`Executing SQL query: ${sql}`);
  }
}

// Low-level module
class PostgreSQLDatabase extends Database {
  connect() {
    console.log('Connecting to PostgreSQL database');
  }
  
  query(sql) {
    console.log(`Executing SQL query: ${sql}`);
  }
}

// High-level module
class UserService {
  constructor(database) {
    this.database = database;
  }
  
  getUser(id) {
    this.database.connect();
    this.database.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`);
  }
}

// Usage
const mySQLDatabase = new MySQLDatabase();
const postgreSQLDatabase = new PostgreSQLDatabase();

const userServiceMySQL = new UserService(mySQLDatabase);
userServiceMySQL.getUser(1);

const userServicePostgreSQL = new UserService(postgreSQLDatabase);
userServicePostgreSQL.getUser(1);
```

## Another example
My app relies directly onto the stripe API, so, if I want to switch to paypal, I'll need to modify all the places where I'm using the Stripe API. This example breaks the DIP. 

To solve this I can add a payment process 'interface' in the middle of my application and the stripe api. T
