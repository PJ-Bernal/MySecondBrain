Upserting is creating resources using put or patch. In most systems, is the server responsibility to create the identifier of a resource, an int for example.

When the consumer POST a new author to the author resource, the server response with a new created author in the response body and the location of the author resource, including the key THE SERVER generates, in the location header. So the server create the URI.

But in REST is fine to let the consumer create the URI.
