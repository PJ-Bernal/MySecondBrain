# About upserting
Upserting is creating resources using put or patch methods. In most systems, is the server responsibility to create the identifier of a resource, an int for example.
## When the server creates the URI

When the consumer POST a new author to the author resource, the server response with a new created author in the response body and the location of the author resource, including the key THE SERVER generates, in the location header. So the server create the URI, in this case: `http://host/api/authors/1`. 

## When the user creates the URI - why using Guids
But in REST is fine to let the consumer create the URI, or when allow, both the consumer and the server. 

Now, if an auto-number field or identity column is being use when creating resources, the user have to know before hand which `ids` are available. Hence, is better to use `Guid`s that will guarantee to be unique across all systems and all time.

When using integers or auto-number fields, the db needs to manage and generate each unique id; however, with Guids each consumer of the API can create resources independently, and choose the Guid that will serve as key in the db. 

Now, POST is not idempontant, sending a POST several times will have different outcomes each time; however, PUT and PATCH are idemponent, so sending multiple puts will end in the exact same result.
