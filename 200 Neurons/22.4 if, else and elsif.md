Because of the above I can write something like this. In this example the code **is not testing if x is equals to 5**, instead, is assigning to x the value of 5, which **always evaluates to true** if the object pointed returns true 

```ruby
if x = 5 # x = nil or x = false evaluates to false
  puts "how can this be true?"
else
  puts "it is not true"
end
```

If I want to check another condition, use `elsif`. The `else` statement don't need to check for something to be executed, also it is optional. 

```ruby
if attack_by_land == true
  puts "release the goat"
elsif attack_by_sea == true
  puts "release the shark"
else
  puts "release Kevin the octopus"
end
```

Detail I use only `end` was used.
