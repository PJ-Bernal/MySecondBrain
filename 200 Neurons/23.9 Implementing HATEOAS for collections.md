First, add a method to create the links. 

![[Pasted image 20250206140013.png]]

To create the links I need a link to the resource itself. The create authors resource URI method can be used to create the links. So, add a resource uri type, named current, that will refer to the resource itself.

Then add a case to the switch of the create authors resource uri.

When the current link is request, the link to the current resource is return , this is the default cases.

Then call the method, and build the links. In this case is a single link because the authors collection can't be deleted or updated in the current implementation.

Add links to the response, and wrap it into the enveloper. First create the links, then shape the data; and for each expando object, add the author links.
