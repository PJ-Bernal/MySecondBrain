When several classes need the same context, they must implement the same `IClassFixture` interface type.

For example, this is a new class but implements the same interface type as the class in the previous note.

In this example the data driven test and the employee service test rely on the same context, meaning, the fixture class will be initialize twice.

So, add a collection fixture, so the fixture only need to be constructed once.

# Add a new class to the fixtures folder
Add a class to the fixtures directory, that implements the `ICollectionFixture` passing the employee service fixture, the type the interface use is the fixture I want to share across several test classes. Detail this type is already created.

>This collection fixture acts like a wrapper around an **existing** fixture.

Then, decorate the class with the collection definition attribute to give it a name to identify the test collection.

# Adding the collection in the classes
Once the collection is created, added to the test classes. The og code.

Decorate the class with the collection attribute passing the collection fixture name. And don't implement the I class fixture interface.

The rest is the same, the constructor, and the method invoking in all test.

 The og code of the other test.
