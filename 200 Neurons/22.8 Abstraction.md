## What is abstraction
Abstraction means internal implementation details of an object are hidden from the user, this means, I can call a method, provide arguments, get a value, but I really don't care what the method is implemented, how it works.  

This also means, the place where I invoke a method doesn't and shouldn't care what goes on under the method. Also, any changes to the method, shouldn't affect part of the code where the method is being called.

## How abstraction is break
One way to break abstraction is chaining the access modifier of an attribute from private to public.
