[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML]]

Generally speaking, unexpected behavior is caused by:
1. Default browser stylesheet styles.
2. Incorrect CSS Values (misspelling for example).
3. Conflicts in the cascade. 

>The **CSS Cascade** is the way our browsers resolve competing CSS declarations, is what determines which rules actually get applied to our HTML. Every ruleset will enter the CSS cascade which will determine whether or not it will end up as the final style. The further down the cascade a declaration falls, the _less likely_ it will end up as the final style.

The cascade has four different tiers.
# Specificity 
A CSS declaration that is more specific will take precedence over less specific ones. Inline styles (`<p style="color: blue;">Hi</p>`) have the highest specificity compared to selectors.

The selector weight in decreasing specificity order is: 

0. Inline styles. 
1. ID selectors. 
2. Class selectors.
3. Type selectors.

>[!info]
>- Specificity will only be taken into account when an element has multiple, conflicting declarations targeting it.
>- When there is no declaration with a selector of higher specificity or same-level selector are in used,  a rule with a greater number of selectors of the same type will take precedence over another rule with fewer selectors of the same type.

>[!example]-
>>[!multi-column]

>>
>>Both rules are using class selectors to call the same element, however, the 'rule 2' is more specific because it's using more class selectors, so the CSS engine will take `color: red;`

>>![[Pasted image 20240131164307.png|center|300]]
>>
>>Here, ID is more specificity though rule 2 has more selectors; so rule one applies `color:blue;`

>[!example]- Advanced selector example
>![[Pasted image 20240131165144.png|center|300]]
>Here, both rulesets are using an ID selector, to this point neither is using a more specific selector. However, the rule 2 is using a class selector in addition to the ID, this, rule 2 has higher specificity.

>[!warning]
>- When a subset of rulesets have a common selector, the CSS engine then checks the number of selectors used on each ruleset. The ruleset applies to the selector with a higher number.
>- **Specificity is only applied when rulesets that have the same property**. In the above example, the color red takes precedence so it applies and also the background-color property. 
>- If two rules have the same weight, the one written lower down in the style sheet wins. 
## Not everything adds to specificity
The universal selector and combinators (`+`, `~`, `>`, and an empty space), don't add any level of specificity. 

>[!example]
>>[!multi-column]
>>
>>![[Pasted image 20240131171248.png|center|150]]
>>Rule 1 uses a chaining selector (no space) and rule 2 uses a descendant combinator (the empty space). But both rules have two classes and the combinator symbol itself does not add to the specificity.
>>
>>![[Pasted image 20240131171509.png|center|150]]
>>This example shows the same thing. Even though rule 2 is using a child combinator (>), this does not change the specificity value. Both rules still have two classes so they have the same specificity values.

>This is an example for the above cases in which the selector used below is being selected.

>Even though rule 1 uses an universal selector, rule 2 has higher specificity using a type selector.
