[[12.12 React|React]]

The keys value should be inferred from the data itself, and not given directly by the component elements. React don't set keys automatically, they must be hard-coded always, or they won't be present. 
## Creating random keys
Keys are passed into the component or DOM element as a prop. 

```jsx
<Component key={keyValue} />
//or
<div key={keyValue} />
```

Ideally a unique component identifier should be a good key. Databases are usually in charge of that, if not, is a good practice to assign one like this:

```jsx
// a list of todos, each todo object has a task and an id
const todos = [
  { task: "mow the yard", id: crypto.randomUUID() },
  { task: "Work on Odin Projects", id: crypto.randomUUID() },
  { task: "feed the cat", id: crypto.randomUUID() },
];

function TodoList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        // here we are using the already generated id as the key.
        <li key={todo.id}>{todo.task}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

When a list remains constant  during the application's life, a good key could be a array's index. However, this is **not entirely a good custom**.

```jsx
const months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December'];

function MonthList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {/* here we are using the index as key */}
      {months.map((month, index) => (<li key={index}>{month}</li>))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Using array as keys
`key={<array name>}` will take each array item and use it as a key. This approach can cause bugs if the array change its order, is a dynamic list or the items are not unique. 

## Keys during rendering
Keys shouldn't be used while rendering because a new key is being generated for every render of the list; so React won't be able to detect which element truly change (all keys are new, thus, all elements change).

```jsx
const todos = [
  { task: "mow the yard", id: crypto.randomUUID() },
  { task: "Work on Odin Projects", id: crypto.randomUUID() },
  { task: "feed the cat", id: crypto.randomUUID() },
];

function TodoList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        // DON'T do the following i.e. generating keys during render
        <li key={crypto.randomUUID()}>{todo.task}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}



```
