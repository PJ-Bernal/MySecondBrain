[[12.2 The internet]]
## What is the HTTP status code - status text
(Remember [[22.2 HTTP request methods#^34db81|what is a response]]) Is a three digit number the server sends back after receiving a request signifying the status of the request. 

![[Pasted image 20231106121949 1.png|center|100]]

This are the most common status codes:

Status Code | Status text | Meaning |
| - | - | - |
| 200 | OK | The request was handled successfully | 
| 302 | Found | The requested resource has changed temporarily. Usually results in a redirect to another URL. |
| 404 | Not Found | The requested resource cannot be found. | 
| 500 | Internal Server Error | The server has encountered a generic error 

### 302 Found
When a resource has been moved (temporarily), the `302 found` response is a re-routing URL address, within the `Location` header, the browser interprets automatically to `redirect` the client to that new URL.  

>[!example]
>When a client want to review it's GitHub account, the first step will be enter to `https://github.com/settings/profile` website. If he isn't log in, the browser will receive a 302 response with a new URL within the `Location` header. 
>
>This new URL has two parts: 
>1. The [[22.2 What is a URL#URL components|scheme, host and path]] ending with `?`.
>2. In this example, the `Location` header contains the [[22.2 What is a URL#URL parameters or query strings|URL parameter]] `return_to` with original URL encoded.
>
>Once user enter his credentials, the browser issue a new request to the new URL that will redirect the client to the `return_to` website.

>[!warning]- Redirection
>The client is redirected twice, once to the log in webpage, another to the original webpage.

>[!tip]- 302 response with Linux
>Remember Linux or a HTTP tool don't interpret the response, thus, the raw response to the 'profile' webpage looks like this.

>Detail the response status next to the HTTP protocol version and the Location header.


### 404 Not found
Response when the resource can't be found.

Detail how there isn't a `Location` response header because no redirection was needed. 

### 500 Internal server error
Server-side issue. This error can be shown in different ways, this is just an example.
