I can work with `FileContetnResult`, `FileStreamResult`, `PhysicalFileResult`, `VirtualFileResult` all derived from the file result class. However, sometimes is more convenient to use the `File` defined in the controller based, that wraps the file result sub classes mentioned. 

In the real world, use a file did to fetch the correct file, this code uses a hard-coded path.

Inside a new con troller, the Files controller.

There's a services called the file extension content type provider that will provide automatically the conte type based on the file extension. In the above code the content is set to text/plain, therefore, if a pdf is downloaded, is not going to show anything. This is in program.cs

Then, inject the service in the controller to be able to use it.

Once created, the try get content type method will try to determine the content type of the file, passing the path of the file and as an output, the a content type var. If the type can be determine, then the content type variable is set to octet-stream, which is a default format for binary data.
