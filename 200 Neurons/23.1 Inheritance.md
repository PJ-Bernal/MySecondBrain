[question:: what exactly is inherited from a superclass to a subclass. ]

Inheritance reduce code repetition and allow easy expansion of the classes, as one attribute or method could be inherit for multiple subclasses. 
## Superclasses and subclasses
The superclass or parent class contains all the attributes that are common to classes that inherit from it. The subclass or child class is an extension of the superclass that inherits all the attributes and methods (it can do everything the superclass can do); subclasses could be superclasses to other classes. This is beneficial for code reusability, specially if the superclass is altering, all the subclasses also will be affected.
## Abstraction 
[question:: What exactly is abstraction within oop]
Having in mind subclasses can be superclasses to other classes, the Cat class can be abstract to create classes for persian, siamese, and more cat types. However, sometimes deciding the abstraction grade is difficult (should both a penguin and a hawk class inherit everything from a Bird class that has a fly method?).

>[!warning]
>These multiple levels of abstraction are one of the reasons why many developers are wary of using inheritance at all. The power of inheritance lies in its abstraction and organization techniques.

In some OO languages (Java, .Net and Swift), a class can only have one single parent, but many children (single inheritance); other languages allow many parents as many children (multiple inheritance - Consider a child that inherits from both parents. Which pair of eyes does the child inherit? ). 

## Is-a relationship
Inheritance creates 'Is-a' relationships; the Dog is a mammal, and the Cat is a mammal. 

>[!warning] Object behavior standardization
>Designing a superclass requires standardizing how to use each subclass. Thus, any common behavior of all the subclasses required the same method call. In this example, when the user wants to draw a shape, only the draw method needs to be called, regardless of what shape is. 
>![[Pasted image 20240111115211 1.png|center|250]]
>The Draw is a method inherited from the Shape class. 
>>[!warning] inherit methods with no implementation
>>For now, one of the advantages to inherit a method with no implementation is to standarize the behavior of the objects. Thus, we could decide that if we want to draw a shape, no matter what shape, we will invoke a method called draw; whenever we want to draw a shape, only the draw method needs to be called, regardless of what the shape is.
