Thanks to the `ApiController` all action methods can return a 400 and other status codes. In the case of the `GetCity` action method it also can return a 404 and 200.

By default, [[23.9 XML comments on action methods#^b77471|not all status codes]] are included by default. 
# Include several responses
Use the `ProducessResponseType` attribute when the action method return several response types.

After that, the documentation show all the response types of the endpoint.

# Return types and swagger
All action methods in the controllers will appear in the swagger UI, regardless if they use `ActionResult`, `IActionResult` or a specific type. However, the return type affects HOW the response is documented (not whether the endpoint itself appears in the documentation)

-	`ActionResult<T>`: the endpoint’s return type is strong-type, hence, swagger is able to include in the documentation. 
-	`IActionResult`: the endpoint's return type is flexible, it returns several types. Swagger is not able to infer the exact response and the use of an attribute could be required, `[ProduceResponseType(StatusCodes.Status200OK, Type = typeof(CityDto))]`
-	Return a specific type like `<CityDto>` swagger infers the response type and is included in the documentation. 

>[!important]
>- If the action method is async and the method is wrapped in a task, that doesn’t affect the described above.   
>- When Shawsbuckle is able to identify the return type of an endpoint, because is returning a specific type or the action method is using `ActionResult`, then, the endpoint and the class model the action method return will be documented. If the endpoint is using `IActionResult`, shawsbuckle can’t identify the return type, therefore, NOT ALL responses will be documented, and the class model that action result returns won’t.

Now, if I need to return an I action result, I will need to indicate the type in the attribute.

>The best practice is use actionresult of T when possible. 

# Override the default response description
Use XML comments to change the default description associated with a status code.
