[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

Tool for dependency management in PHP, letting me install various libraries and packages into the project. It also help with [[22.8 How autoloader works|autoloading]].
## How to install composer
In windows I can install as a program. For development, I can add the composer to the docker file that runes PHP. But for production, it might be better to have Composer in a separate container to save on resources. 

This is one way to install Composer. Because Gio is using Docker, and it has the curl available, he uses that command (the end of the command is simply composer). This will install it in a user local bin directory with the file name composer.

Then I have to cd into the docker directory (Gio has a separate Docker directory with two files). The second command rebuild the Docker image.

Then I have to SSH into the Docker container. First, type docker ps, to look for the container name in this case is programmingio-app. Then type the last command ending with bash.

Now, I'm within the container, so I can type  ![[Pasted image 20240313104230.png]]

This will print all the composer commands.

The most use commands will be composer command, require, install, update and remove. 

>I can find packages I want to install on packagist.org or in the documentation of the library I'm trying to install.
