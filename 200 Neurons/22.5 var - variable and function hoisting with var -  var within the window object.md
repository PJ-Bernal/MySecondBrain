[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

## var
`var` scope is the <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">current execution context</mark>, either global (only if the variable is declare within the main script) or function scope, not block! check [[22.5 Variable hoisting - declaration vs initialization - hoisting functions - hoisting classes - nested functions#Variables are hoisted first in their context and no code is executed|this]] and [[22.5 Variable hoisting - declaration vs initialization - hoisting functions - hoisting classes - nested functions#Var hasn't have block scope|this]] example. 

It can eb really useful but for very specific cases. So, avoid its use and try to use `let` instead. 

```js
console.log(hoist); // Output: undefined - This is not an error. Becuase JS know about the existance of the variable here
var hoist = 'The variable has been hoisted.';
```

In this example, `x` has global scope because the declaration is not within a function but a block, therefore, the console works fine.

```js
if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
  var x = 1;
} else {
  var x = 2;
}
console.log(x);
```

The result is `undefined` because the variable declaration (not the assignation) has been hoisted (no assignation has been made, so the <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">variable default init</mark> is `undefined`), and <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">the initialization remains in the same place</mark>. For the interpreted, the previous code looks like this:

```js
console.log(hoist); // Output: undefined
hoist = 'The variable has been hoisted.';
```

This is how the compiler see the code. 

```js 
var hoist = undefined;

console.log(hoist); // Output: undefined
hoist = 'The variable has been hoisted.';
```

## Var as a window object property
>[!blank-container|float-left]

Variables declare with `var` holding any value type become `window` object properties. Remember that anything that is within the window object can be use for my code.  ^7ff085

In this example, within the html script, the first js file has a variable declared `var miNombre = 'Fernando';`, and the second script is calling that variable.

Detail that second file, though it doesn't have the variable anywhere in the script, it can be called because it makes part of the `window` object.

Detail this image is from writing `window` in the console of google. Detail the variable is there so any js file can access to it.

### Variable hoisting
Another example of hoisting. Remember to check the [[22.5 Variable hoisting - declaration vs initialization - hoisting functions - hoisting classes - nested functions#Hoisting variables|the variable hoist section here]].

>>// other stuff
>>}

>This means all var declarations are processed at function start, so they are referenceable at any place. But variables are undefined until the assignments. 

This is another example of variable hoisting in functions.

```javascript
function sayHi() {
  phrase = "Hello";
  alert(phrase);
  var phrase;
}
sayHi();
```

### Function hoisting
>[!example] Example of function-level variable with var
>If a code block is inside a function, var becomes function level.
>```JS
>function sayHi() {
> if (true) {
>    var phrase = "Hello";
>  }
>
  alert(phrase); // works
}
>
>sayHi();
>alert(phrase); // ReferenceError: phrase is not defined
>```

`var` allows to work with variables before being declared, however, I couldn't find any useful case as the variable is initialized with `undefined`.  ^1e56bc

>[!info] How to prevent this?
>Symply declare and initialize the variables at the top of the scope.

This example shows how `var` is a function, not block scoped; also the variable gets reassigned, **check [[22.5 Variable hoisting - declaration vs initialization - hoisting functions - hoisting classes - nested functions#var reassigned each other within the same context of execution|this example]].**

```js
// Use var to initialize a variable
var species = "human";

if (fullMoon) {
  // Attempt to create a new variable in a block
  var species = "werewolf";
  console.log(`${species}.`); //werewolf
}

console.log(` ${species}.`); //werewolf
```

>[!info] Var tolerates redeclarations
>When redeclaring, the already-declared variables gets ignored.
>>[!example]
>>```JS
>>var user = "Pete";
>>
>>var user = "John"; // this "var" does nothing (already declared)
>>// ...it doesn't trigger an error
>>
>>alert(user); // John
>>```

## Var variables are within the window object
