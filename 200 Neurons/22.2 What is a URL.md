## What URL stands for?
<mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">URL</mark> (Uniform Resource Locator) is the web browser address to access a website. 
## URL components
Based on the next URL: `http://www.example.com:88/home?item=book` it can break in 5 parts:

![[Pasted image 20231019125423 1.png|center|]]

>[!note]- Scheme (http)
>- Always comes before the :// <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">tells the client how to access the resource</mark>, in this case with an HTTP to make a request. There are other schemes like `ftp`, `mailto` or `git`. Sometimes use the 'protocol' to refer to the scheme, but the right term is scheme.

>[!note]- Host (www.example.com)
>- Tells the client where the resource is hosted or located. 

^e66d7e

>[!note]- Port (:88)
>- Only required to access an specific resource if the <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">default HTTP port</mark> (80) is not enough. 

>[!note]- Path (/home)
>- Shows what local resource is being requested. This part is optional.
>- Sometimes it can point to a specific resource on the host, e.g. www.example.com/home/index.html this points into an HTML file. 

>[!note]- query string/URL parameters
This is an URL with a query string `http://www.example.com?search=ruby&results=10` The query is optional, and contains certain parts:
>- ? Reserve character that marks the start of the query string and the end of the resource path. 
>- search=ruby Parameter name/value pair.
>- & Reserved character used to add more parameters to the query string.
>- results=10 another parameter name/value pair.

## URL parameters or query strings

![[Pasted image 20231106141754 1.png|center|500]]

URL parameters are <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">queries pairs</mark> <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">(key-value)</mark> (for example: `product=iphone`, `size=32gb`) that sort content on a page based on a client's request. All that goes after `?` is a URL parameter. To separate multiple parameters the `&` is required. . <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">_How the server uses these parameters is up to the server_.</mark> ^1d1398

## Query strings (POST vs GET)
Bits of information included in the URL when making a request. Detail how the query appear in the URL when using a search engine.

![[Pasted image 20231101204200 1.png|center|300]]


<mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">GET requests</mark> ([[22.2 HTTP request methods#GET request|Read GET request]]) is the most common request type, hence there are other types. 

<mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">POST request</mark> ([[22.2 HTTP request methods#POST request|Read POST request]]) technically could have query strings, but is<mark style="background: #D23D3D78;"> not common and a not good practice</mark> because the send data might potentially logged or recorded somewhere. 

### Queries limitations

^0a229a

- Have a maximum length. Long data can't pass through the query.
- Name/value pair is visible on the URL, therefore passing sensitive information to the server is not recommended.
- Special characters like & and space can't be use, meaning the query must be URL encoded. 

## URL encoding
<mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">URLs</mark> accept <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">only certain character</mark>s in the<mark style="background: #D23D3D78;"> standard 128-character ASCII</mark> character set (only alphanumeric and special characters like `$-_.+!'()",`). Other characters must be encoded, that is replacing those characters with a % symbol followed by the hexadecimal digit that represent the equivalent UTF-8 character. 

Remember UTF-8 uses 1 to 4 bytes to represent every possible Unicode character. All ASCII and extended ASCII characters have a single-byte UTF-8 code. Here is an example. 

Char | UTF-8 code | URL
-|-|-
Space | %20 | http://www.thedesignshop.com/shops/tommy%20hilfiger.html
$ | %24 | http://www.spam.com/i-have-%2410-million-for-you
€ | %E2%82%AC | http://www.spam.com/big-inheritance-%E2%82%AC-millions

### Characters must be encoded if
1. Don't have a corresponding character within the standard ASCII character set. 
2. **Use of characters is unsafe** since it may be misinterpreted or modified by some systems. E.g. % is used to encode other characters, other characters use spaces; `#`, `<`, `>` are other examples,
3. The character is reserved for special use within the URL scheme, such as `/`, `?`, `:`, `@` and `&` are reserved and must be encoded.
## Questions
[question:: how to retrieve information with post via URL query strings, and why it is a bad practice]
[question:: only GET uses the URL to make the request? How does it mean POST use the HTTP body]
[question:: "Name/value pair is visible on the URL, therefore passing sensitive information to the server is not recommended." So if Im not passing that information to the server, how the server know who am I]
