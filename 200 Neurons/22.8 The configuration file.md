[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

The configuration file of PHP is called `php.ini`. In XAMPP, click on the config button on the apache row. 
## Basic rules
Text within `[]` is ignore, semicolon indicates documentation comments and lines without a semicolon are the pairs directive/values. All the settings, also called directives, are there. 

The `php.ini` file has two main sections:
- `quick reference` with important values of all directives. 
- `language options` in which the directives can be change.

### The changeable column
[This](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php) is a list of all php.ini directives. The "Changeable" column indicates where an specific directive can be change from, based on [these constants](https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.modes.php); for example `INI_SYSTEM` or `INI_PEDIR` can't be edited within the script. 

When a directive can be edited within the script, `ini_get()` gets the directive, and `ini_set()` updates the value of a directive during runtime. **This change last only during script execution**. 

>[!important]
>Is a good practice to set as much directives within the `php.ini` file, rather than within the script file.

>When the ini file has been change, the apache server needs to be restarted. 

## How to get and change directive within a script
>[!info] To get or check a directive
>>[!multi-column]

>>When a directive is changeable within a script, is represented with a integer constant value. Use `ini_get()` to obtain the constant value

>[!multi-column]
>
>In this case, the production value is set to `error_reporting=E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT` meaning show all errors, except for notices and coding standards warning.

>[!important] Always use E_ALL
>IS not a good practice to hide any kind of error. 

### Display errors
>[!multi-column]
>
>To decide if I want the errors appear on the browser or not. 1, for yes, 0 for no.
>%% %%
>In production I could use 0 to don't show any of the sensitive information within my errors to the user. By doing this, the errors **will be logged**.

### Error log
>[!multi-column]
>
>Indicates where the error should be log. 

### Post max size
Determine how much data can be posted in a request.

### Max execution time
>[!multi-column]
>
>Sets the maximum number of seconds the script can run before its timeout and terminated. An error appears here because the application sleeps for 5 seconds, but the max execution time is 3.   
>

### Memory limit
`memory_limit`, sets the maximum amount of memory a script can consume. Set to -1 removes the memory limit, not a good practice.
### File uploads
Enables or disables the file uploads on PHP. 
### Upload_tmp_dir
Indicates the temp folder where the temp file will be store when doing file uploads.
### upload_max_size
### default_time_zone
### include_path
Specifies the list of directories where the `require/include` and other function that deal with opening file will look for files by default.
