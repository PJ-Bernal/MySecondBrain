[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

Function can implement interfaces. This is a good practice, of having the function signatures defined, and then, implement those inside of the objects when needed. 

```ts
interface ReviewLogger {
  (chars: string): void;
}

interface Movie {
  title: string,
  director: string
  length?: number,
  logReview?: ReviewLogger
}

const myMovie: Movie = {
  title: "Inception",
  director: "Christopher Nolan",
  logReview: (comment: string) => {
    return `Review: ${comment}`;
  },
};

// Calling the logReview function
if (myMovie.logReview) {
  console.log(myMovie.logReview("Amazing movie!", 9));
}
```

But this interface is just like any other type, so I can type a variable with that type. This is useful for having methods with different implementations but same parameters and return types.

Detail the object implementation and this one are different. 

```ts
let printReview: ReviewLogger = (review: string) => console.log(`This is your review! ${review}`);
```
