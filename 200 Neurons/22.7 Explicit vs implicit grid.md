## Explicit grid
Happens when grid elements are layout following the defined `grid-template-column` and `grid-template-rows` properties. 

## Implicit grid
If I have two tracks per column and row, but I decided to put a fifth element in my HTML, this new element will be slotted into a third row that hasn't been defined. Then, the implicit grid concept place automatically new grid elements. 

Using `grid-template-column` and `grid-template-rows` define explicitly the tracks, thus, when the grid needs more tracks for extra content, it will **implicitly** define a new tracks based on the given ones. 

>[!warning]
>Implicit grid tracks only carry the first  `grid-template-column` value; any of the `grid-template-rows` value aren't carry.

To set new tracks implicitly (for new added elements) I can use the `grid-auto-rows` and `grid-auto-columns` properties, to be in control of the tracks and don't let CSS figure out them. 

### How new implicit elements are added
By default new elements are added row-by-row, in a vertical fashion. To change this default behavior I can use `grid-auto-flow: column` that use the implicit track property `grid-auto-column`.
