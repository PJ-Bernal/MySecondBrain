# About the folder structure
One way of creating the folder structure for an REST API is creating one project with the web api template, and creating the required directories.

Another way is creating three projects inside a solution: 
- API (using the web api template, `Movies.API`): project responsible for handling HTTP request, routing. This project may include: controllers, `program.cs`, `appsettings.json`, `DI` container to register services, `middleware`, `mappings`. 
- Business logic (using the class library template, `Movies.Application`): project independent from the API that handles the core logic of the app. It may contain: services, repositories, domain models, interfaces and validations. 
- Contract (class library, `Movies.Contract`): defines the shared contracts, dtos, interfaces and enums, across the API and the business logic layers. It may include: DTOs, request responses folder, enums and interfaces. 

This approach is kind of the same as MVC, but in three projects. Also, it offers the advantage of, the contract (request and response objects) project can be converted in a nuget package for other users, so all consumer are in sycn with the contracts the API is exposing.  

After creating the three projects, right click in api dependencies -> add reference, and reference the api to the other two projects.  ^7a0917

The above approach makes more secular the distribution of the REST system layers, the application layer is completely agnostic from the API.  

# About the contract project
This is the same as the Model directory that holds all the DTOs. This approach of having the DTOs separate is better.
