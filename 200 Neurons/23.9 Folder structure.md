# About the folder structure
One way of creating the folder structure for an REST API is creating one project with the web api template, and creating the required directories.

Another way is creating three projects inside a solution, for the API (using the web api template, `Movies.API`), the business logic (using the class library template, `Movies.Application`) and the contract (class library, `Movies.Contract`). This approach is kind of the same as MVC, but in three projects. Also, it offers the advantage of, the contract (request and response objects) project can be converted in a nuget package for other users, so all consumer are in sycn with the contracts the API is exposing.  

After creating the three projects, right click in api dependencies -> add reference, and reference the api to the other two projects.

The above approach makes more secular the distribution of the REST system layers, the application layer is completely agnostic from the API.  

# About the contract project
This is the same as the Model directory that holds all the DTOs. This approach of having the DTOs separate is better.
