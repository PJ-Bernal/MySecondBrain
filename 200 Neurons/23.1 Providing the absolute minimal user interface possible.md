>[!info]- Steps to create a minimal user interface
When designing a class, the user should be provided with little knowledge of the inner workings of the class as possible. To do this, follow this steps.

## Determining the users 
In general, any object that sends a message to another object is considered a user. 

>[!info]- Users on a taxi system example
Based on the [[23.1 Interface design using abstract thinking#^315e29|taxi]] system service example, the first impulse to say who the users are is to answer, the customers. But, what if this 'customer' wants a free ride? In reality, to build a realistic and usable interface, _both_ the customer and the cabbie must be users of the system.

## Object behavior
From the viewpoint of _all the users_, begin identifying the purpose of each object and what it must do to perform properly. Some choices won't survive the final cut; to identify those choices, requirements can be gathered using methods such as UML use cases.

## Environmental constraints
Limitations on what the object can do, this is always a factor. 

## Identifying public interfaces
With the information gathered above, now determine the public interfaces for how to use the object and what the user needs to use it; keeping in mind how the object is used and not how is built.

Based on the determined uses and 'needs', here is a prototype of a class diagram. If an interface doesn't contribute to the operation of the object, perhaps isn't necessary. Many textbooks recommend that each interface (each method) model only one behavior. 

## Identifying implementation
The steps above define the process of designing a class. Once is done (and the methods to operate the class are in place) the specifics of how to get the class to work are considered. 

Technically, anything that is not a public interface can be considered the implementation; the user will never see any of the methods that are considered part of the implementation (private methods, some for use class only, the user won't have access to them, but other method's implementation can invoke them), including the method's signature (name of the method, parameter list and code inside). 

The implementation is totally hidden from the user. The code within public methods is a part of the implementation because the user cannot see it. (The user should see only the calling structure of an interfaceâ€”not the code inside it.) Once again, anything that is considered the implementation might change without affecting how the user interfaces with the class.

Whereas the interface represents how the user sees the object, the implementation is really the nuts and bolts of the object. The implementation contains the code that represents the state of an object.
