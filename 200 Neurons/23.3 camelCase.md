[[13.3 Clean code]]

camelCase is a naming convention that allows writing multiple words together without spaces or punctuation. In camelCase, when a variable name consists of multiple words like our setTimeout example, the first word is written completely in lowercase, while the second word (and any subsequent words) are capitalized.
