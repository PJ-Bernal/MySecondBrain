[[12.12 React|React]]

## Test boilerplate
The test file must be named `filename.test.jsx`, the two first imports are mandatory, and the last one is the component import.

This is the basic syntax of a text. The first two imports and required, and then import the component. Use `describe()` to group multiple text, or use `test()` or its alias `it()` for individual tests; both methos use two parameters, a string that represents the name of the test, and a function that contains the test code. Then create the required mockups and then use the `render()` method. 

```jsx
// App.test.jsx

import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import App from "./App";

describe("App component", () => {
  it("renders correct heading", () => {
    render(<App />);
    expect(screen.getByRole("heading").textContent).toMatch(/our first test/i);
  });
});
```

Then execute: `npm test App.test.jsx` or `npm test`. 

>[!important]
>RTL test should tell how the user will react to the website, rather the component implementation itself. 

### Render and screen
- Render creates a browser environment for the component. Its parameter are created as HTML elements, take from the JSX of the component. 
- Screen allow to scan 'visually' the environment, providing methods to find elements in the component using: 
	- `getByText`: finds an element or throws an error. 
	- `getByRole`: returns null if nothing found (good for checking absence)
	- `getByTestId`: return a promise, good for async content. 
### debug
To see the HTML of the component, use `screen.debug();`. 

### Jest custom matchers
Jest provide several [assertive functions](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-matchers) that can be used with screen objects, like, `.toMatch()`. 

## Queries
Queries are special RTL methods to find and test elements within a website, distributes in three tiers.

All queries return an actual DOM instance element, just like using `document.querySelector`, with properties, methods and the prototype chain. 

Remember checking the [table](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about). 
### Query type
- `get`: expects to find the element.
- `query`: used when the element might not be there.
- `find`: for async elements. 
### Search criteria
To determine which to use, see the [documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/). 
- `ByRole`: finds by ARIA role or HTML tag; interactive elements like buttons, link, text button. The role is not related with any React state name or variable name, but attached to the HTML use to build the element. 
 
The, the `name` option allows to filter by the accessible name determine by this order:  `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, text content of the element. This query should be use as first resource. It returns a single element. 

This query verify the element has a valid ARIA role explicitly with `role='button'` or implicitly from the HTML element with `<button>`, and the element is exposed in the accessibility tree meaning is not hidden with `aria-hidden='true'`, `display:none`, `visibility: hidden` or is not inside a hidden container.  

```jsx
// Text content provides accessible name
<button>Click Me</button>
// accessible name: "Click Me"

// aria-label overrides text content
<button aria-label="Submit form">Click Me</button>
// accessible name: "Submit form"

// Combines visible and screen reader text
<button>
  Click Me
  <span className="sr-only">to submit form</span>
</button>
// accessible name: "Click Me to submit form"
```

- `ByText` - selects the element that contains the text passed as an argument, use for paragraphs, or non-interactive elements with text. I can use regex: `screen.getByText(/Hello W?oRlD/i)`. 
- `ByLabelText` - selects form elements whose `htmlfor` attribute matches the string argument. 
- `ByPlaceholderText` - selects inputs by placeholder

- `ByAltText` - selects images by alt text
- `ByTitle` - selects by title attribute

- `ByTestId` - selects by test ID
- `ByDisplayValue` - selects by current value, useful for input or text area. 
### Plurality
For multiple elements use `All`. 

`getBy`, `queryBy`, `findBy` are RTL [queries](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/), methods classify in different types. For example, 
`ByRole` are methods for querying, especially when paired with the name option, like this.

```jsx
getByRole("heading", { name: "Our First Test" })
```

This queries ensure the UI is accessible to everyone no matter which technology is being used to navigate the webpage.

### Selecting an id
If the query methods don't suit to find an element, add the data test id attribute to an element and use the test id method.

```jsx
<span data-testid="mySpan">Hello</span>
const el = getByTestId('mySpan');
```

## screen object
Before `screen`, when using a new query method, the destructive render must be updated.

```jsx
// Old approach without screen
test('component test', () => {
  const { getByText, getByRole, queryByTestId } = render(<MyComponent />);
  
  // Now you use the destructured methods
  const button = getByText('Click me');
  const input = getByRole('textbox');
  const element = queryByTestId('special-div');
});

// New query method to be used: findByText
// Update the destructive

const { getByText, getByRole, queryByTestId, findByText } = render(<MyComponent />);
```

With the screen object **all** query methods available. 

```jsx
// Modern approach with screen
test('component test', () => {
  render(<MyComponent />);
  
  // All query methods are available through screen
  const button = screen.getByText('Click me');
  const input = screen.getByRole('textbox');
  const element = screen.queryByTestId('special-div');
  
  // Need a new query method? No problem, it's already there
  const asyncElement = await screen.findByText('Loaded');
});
```

## After each test
RTL remove any component from the DOM ensuring each test has a fresh state.

## How to write an efficient test
Generally, there are two users of the components: the end-users and the developers. The first will interact with the component (click, dragging, writing), seeing it. The second interact with the component by rendering appropriately passing the correct props. 

This is what RTL does. First I passed the test some fake props, then interact with the render to make some clicks, to expect something. 

Remember to not test any implementation and always check the [[22.12 What is mocking|three initial test]] when testing a callback.
