[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

A general rule in programming is that you do not want your methods to overwrite the objects that you call them on. If I want the object to change I can create a copy assigning the return value to a variable. 

```ruby
quiet_version = "hello there"
loud_version = quiet_version.upcase # This creates a copy, but the object remains the same 

puts loud_version #This is another object, not the quiet_version
#=> HELLO THERE

puts quiet_version
#=> hello there
```

But mutator methods perform in-place operations that modify and overwrite the original invoking object.

>[!important]
>- Mutator methods ends with `!`, like `upcase!`
>- Not all mutator methods have an exclamation mark (like pop and push)
>- Not all methods have a mutator version. 
>- For strings, the stripe `<<` act as a mutator method.
>- Writing `whisper.downcase!` is the equivalent of writing `whisper = whisper.downcase`.

```ruby
tom = "kitty"
jerry = tom

tom << "kat" # doing jerry<<"kat" gives the same result as both variables are pointing the same object

puts tom 
#=> kittykat

puts jerry   
#=> kittykat
```

Compare to this. Remember, in this example, I'm altering the object tom is pointing at, by making a copy of it self. 

```ruby
tom = "kitty"
jerry = tom
tom += "kat" #  Same as tom = tom + "kat" or tom = [copy of tom] + "kat"

puts jerry   
#=> kitty

puts tom   
#=> kittykat
```

>Some operations mutate the address space, while others simply make the variable point to a different address space.

## map! and select!
Both of those enum methods are mutator.
