[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

## Accessible colors
There are two conformance level for contrast ratios for normal text (font size less than 18 points or 24 px or less than 14 points/18.66px for bold text), and large text (at least 18 points/24px (or at least 14 points/18.66px for bold text):

- Level AA (minimum) requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
- Level AAA (enhanced) requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.

Both conformance levels have exceptions if the text is decorative, is part of an inactive or disabled user interface or is part of a logo or brand.

To test ratios use the [contrast checker website](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) or use the 'element picker' from Chrome dev tools and hover over an element to check the contrast under the accessibility section.

## Convey information

An element shouldn't use color alone to convey information (if a user is color blind my website couldn't say "select the red button"). Therefore, my website, specially a form, required a visual que.
