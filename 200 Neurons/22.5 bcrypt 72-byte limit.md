The following limitation is the same for bcrypt and bcryptjs. 
## Security breach
When hashing a password with the user name and the password, a user id could be the same as the hash user id. This is not a bug, but a limitation the 72-byte limit of bcrypt. 

```js
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs')

const length = 73
const userIdOne = '0'.repeat(lenght)
const userIdTwo = '0'.repeat(lenght) + '1'

const hashOne = bcrypt.hashSync(userIdOne) // Creates hash
const hashTwo = bcrypt.hashSync(userIdTwo)

// CompareSync 'de-hash' the hash
console.log(bcrypt.compareSync(userIdOne, hashOne)) //true
console.log(bcrypt.compareSync(userIdTWo, hashOne)) //true
console.log(bcrypt.compareSync(userIdOne, hashTwo)) //true
console.log(bcrypt.compareSync(userIdOne, hashTwo)) //true
```

When bcrypt process a password, it first converts the first 72 bytes input string into UTF-8, any character beyond 72-byte limit are silently truncated. 


This happens to Okta, if a username is 52 or more characters, the account can be access regardless of the password. This happens because the cache key combined the user id, username and the password. 

Look in the example, the same code works properly if the user name is below 52 characters. 

```js
const userOneName = 'test'
const userOnePass = '123'

const userTwoName = 'dog'
const userTwoPass = '123'

const hashOne = bcrypt.hashSync(userIdOne) // Creates hash
const hashTwo = bcrypt.hashSync(userIdTwo)

// CompareSync 'de-hash' the hash
console.log(bcrypt.compareSync(userIdOne, hashOne)) //true
console.log(bcrypt.compareSync(userIdTWo, hashOne)) //false
console.log(bcrypt.compareSync(userIdOne, hashTwo)) //false
console.log(bcrypt.compareSync(userIdOne, hashTwo)) //true
```

In this code, because the user id is long enough, regardless what's appended at the end, the account is already vulnerable. Imagine if, for some reason, the user id is 18 characters, and the user nae is 52, then add the password at the end and hash is useless. 
 
```js
const userIdOne = 'superduperultralongextrateratetralongusename+password'
```

>Bcrypt is design for password hashing, not cache key generation. 
## The solution
- Is a  bad practice to use the user id, username and password to create a hash. However, regardless of what the hash items will be, always pre-hash. Only hash the password. 
- Limit the password length, so the user can't type more than X amount of characters. 
- Don't use the user name directly, as the cache key. 
- When hashing, don't user 'public' or user information directly, because the user could manipulate that. First, pre-hash.

```js
const crypto = require('crypto');
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');

function secureHash(password) {
    // First hash with SHA-256 to get a fixed-length string
    const preHash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(password).digest('base64');
    // Then use bcrypt on the pre-hashed string
    return bcrypt.hashSync(preHash);
}
```
