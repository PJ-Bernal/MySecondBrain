# Has-a relationship
Composition represents a 'has-a' relationship, in which some classes are accessible only through other. An employee has an address, hence, the address is accessible only through employee.

# Adding composition
Once a class is created, the "main" class must have a property (field + accessor methods) whose type is the "derived" class.

# Composition and constructors
Once the relationship is created like above. The "main" class can include the 'derived' class within the constructor by creating an instance, therefore, the main class, when instantiated, will also instantiate the derived class.

# Accessing fields from the 'derived' class
The main class instance contains within an instance of the derived class, thus, to access a field of the derived class through the main class (because this is a has-a relationship), use the main class object, calling the derived class type, that then can call a property of the derived class.
