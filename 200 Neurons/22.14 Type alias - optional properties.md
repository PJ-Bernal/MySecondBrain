## Type alias

When creating an instance there is not direct way to know if the instance 'belongs' to a define instance type. 

In this example, the return object shows a generic object with two properties, but I want to encapsule my instances to make them type User. 

Type alias allow to create hard-coded types for any value type. To define a type use the `type` keyword followed by a Pascal-case name, and then provide a type definition.

Now, the type of the instance is the type User. The return type is what is defined within the type definition. 

Once the type is defined, the instances of the Type must contain only the Type definition types.

When a function parameters are the Type definition, like in this case, I can simply `<parameterName>: <TypeName>`.

>When doing this, the argument need to be pass as the exact type the parameter was defined, in this case, user is an object type, so when invoking the function I need to pass an object.

Another way is to include the destructive syntax within the parameter definition. 

```js
function createUser2({ name, age }: User): User {
  return { name, age };
}
```

The Type definition and the objects are not require to have the same properties name, check the optional properties example. 
## Optional properties
When defining a new type I can place optional parameters using `?:`, meaning the type, the object, can have or not that property. 

```js
type User = {
    name: string,
    age: number,
    favFood?: string,
}

function createUser({ name, age, favFood }: User): User {
    return { name, age, favFood };
  }

const Pablo = {
    name: 'Pablo',
    age: 30,
}

const Ana = {
    name: 'Pablo',
    age: 30,
    food: 'sushi',
}
const firstUser = createUser(Ana);
const secondUser = createUser(Pablo);
```

## Optional chaining operator
`?.` operator that checks if a property or method is present within an object instance when it might be null or undefined. If the object before ?. is null or undefined, the expression short-circuits and returns undefined instead of throwing an error.

If the asked property/method is not even within the type definition, TS will mark an error.

```js
console.log(firstUser?.favFood) // undefined (no error)
```
