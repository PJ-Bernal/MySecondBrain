[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML]]

## Paragraphs
The browser don't interpret line breaks as line breaks. Therefore, each paragraph must be on one `<p>` tag. 
## Headings
Large and bold headings, from `<h1>` the 'most relevant' to `<h6>`, 'less relevant'. One `<h1>` should be used to define the main heading of a webpage as search engines use it to understand the topic of the page. Any other subheading should be added under `<h2>` tags and so on. 

>[!multi-column]
>
>Only primary keywords should be use. 
>%% %%
>Overload the header. 
>
>`<h1>Best Mutual Funds of 2023</h1>`
>%% %%
> `<h1> Best Mutual Funds In 2021: Best Mutual Funds List</h1>`

>[!info]
>There are more formatting elements, but these are the most used and important. 
## `strong` element
Makes the content text bold and marks it as important (affecting screen readers). 

>[!multi-column]
>
>`<p>This is an<strong>example</strong></p>`
>
>This is an **example**

Making a text bold with CSS will remove "it's importance" for screen readers, for example. 
## `em` element
Makes text italic, place emphasis for screen readers. 

>[!multi-column]
>
>`<p>This is an<em>example</em></p>`
>
>This is an _example_

Making a text italic with CSS will remove "it's importance" for screen readers, for example. 

## Nesting and indentation
Nesting elements via indentation (using two spaces), creates a parent-child relationship that is crucial when working with CSS and JS.
