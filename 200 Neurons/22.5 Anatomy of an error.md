>Errors in JS are a built-in object!

An error consists of:
- The name or type of error. Same named errors could have different descriptions. `Uncaught ReferenceError` is the name in this case and after `:` are the details
- Name of the file and line number. In this case the file's name is `script.js`, that are an actual link I can click and the browser will take me to that specific line. 
	- Column or character. Some browsers will even detail the column in which the error is happening. `at script.js:4:13`.

## Stack trace
