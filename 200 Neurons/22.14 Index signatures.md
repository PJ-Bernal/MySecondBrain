# About index signatures
When developing, objects/hashes can evolve to include properties that didn't make part of the original object design. Index signatures are often used when the keys of an object are dynamic or not known ahead of time.
## Syntax
Use `[key: keyType]: valueType`, for example:

```ts
const x: {[key: string]: string} = {}
x.foo = 'test';
x.foo2 = 3; // this won't work
```

In this example, all new properties, both their key and value, must be an string. 

```ts
const phones: {
    [k: string]: {
        country: string
        area: string
        number: string
    }
} = {
     home: { country: "+1", area: "211", number: "652-4515" },
     work: { country: "+1", area: "670", number: "752-5856" },
     fax: { country: "+1", area: "322", number: "525-4357" },
}
```

Detail custom_1 doesn't exists in the hash, but I can added thanks to the index signature. 





## 'Unknown and known' properties

>Index signatures are 'unknown' properties for TS, they could be added or not. Meaning, when creating an object, if its type uses only index signatures, at the moment of creating the object, TS won't know the object properties. 


This means, I can have explicit defined fields on top of index signature fields.

# Convention and type safety
When using index signatures, TS can't guarantee that a specific key exists on the object. Therefore, when requesting a known property use dot notation, when reaching an index signature property use `[<property name>]`.

```ts
phones.custom = {country: "+1", area: "211", number: "652-4515" }
phones["custom"]

//When the key is not found
console.log(phones["MyHome"]);  // undefined, but no TypeScript error
```
