[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

Several HTML elements are responsive by default until CSS change its behavior. This mindset allow me to be aware that not that much CSS should be added to make a website responsive.

Responsive means the webpage should look nice regardless the screen size or orientation. Responsive doesn't mean the website should look identical on every screen size; In fact, that would actually be problematic in a few ways. For example, the proportions of your header, footer, and the main content of your site that looks nice on a phone screen will be quite different from what people expect to see on a normal desktop monitor.
