[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML]]

## Anchor elements
The anchor, `<a> </a>`, is defined by wrapping the text or another HTML element to make it a link. Anchor tags can link to any resource on internet (any section of a HTML documents, videos, pdf files, etc. )

>[!multi-column]
>
>Any text wrapped with an anchor tag without a `href` will look like plain text. 
>
>Therefore, the `href=""` , hypertext reference, passes the destination to the anchor tag about where to go.  
>
>`<a href="https://youtube.com">Click me</a>` <a href="https://youtube.com">Click me</a>

### Opening links in a new tab / `target` and `rel` attributes
#### target
The method above opens links in the same tab, to change this behavior, use the `target` attribute. If the attribute is not present, by default it will take on the `_self` value with opens the link in the current tab. 

>[!multi-column]
>
>To open the link in a new tab or window (depends on browser settings). 
>%% %%
>To use the same new tab, to open what ever link is within the page.
>
>`target="_blank"`
>%% %%
>%% %%
>`target="blank"`
#### rel
Describe the relation between a linked resource and the linked document. It has several values, but two important are:
- `noopener`: prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened. Issue known as tabnapping. 
- `noreferrer`: value can be added if you wish to not let the opened link know that your webpage links to it.

>[!warning] Security concerns
>>[!multi-column]
>>
>>This two attributes are needed for security reasons. (more information [here](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Reverse_Tabnabbing) and [here](https://outreachmonks.com/rel-noopener-noreferrer/)). Using `rel="noreferrer"` implies also `rel="noopener"`, so if you have chosen to use `rel="noreferrer"`, the use of `rel="noopener"` isnâ€™t required.
>>
>>However, in newer browser versions, using `target="_blank"` implicitly provides the same protection as setting `rel="noopener"`
>
>`noopener` prevents phishing where the opened link may change the original webpage to a different one 

>[!multi-column]
>
>Nevertheless, good coding and security practices dictates to pair the `_blank` with `noopener noreferrer`
>
>`<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer">click me</a>`

## Absolute and relative links
### Absolute
Link to pages on other websites. A typical absolute link is made up to: `protocol://domain/path` and will always contain the protocol and domain.
### Relative
Links to other pages within my own website. They don't include the domain name (the link assumes it will be the same as the page having the link) but the file path to other page.

Usually websites are organized in directories with `index.html` in the root directory and all other HTML files in their own directory. 

>[!multi-column]
>
>When using a relative link, the `href` attribute has to contain the path to the webpage. To prevent unexpected issues, add `./` 
>

## Images
The `<img>` is a void element, it embeds and image using the `src=""` attribute to tell the browser where the image file is located. 

As relative links, adding `./` when providing the path could solve some unexpected issues.
### Parent directories
>[!multi-column]
>
>Parent directory is a folder that contain the folder the actual HTML file, in this case, 'odin-links-and-images' is a parent directory of `about.html`. 
>%% %%
>Using this notation, an HTML file from one folder can use files from another folder.
>
>%% %%
>Calling the parent directory, the `about.html` file can use an image in another file; `<img src="../images/dog.jpg">`
>%% %%
>To break this down: go to the parent directory, then go to images, and access dog. 
### `alt` attribute
Attribute used to describe the image, it'll shown if the image can't be loaded and for screen readers. 
### Image size attributes
Is not strictly required, but is a good habit to always specify the height and width attributes within the image tag of every image. It helps the browser layout jump and flash. [[22.7 Aspect ratio, width, height and CLS|This is]] an example of how to solve it.
