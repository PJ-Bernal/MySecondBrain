[[12.12 React|React]]
The render algorithm divides in three phases: trigger, render and commit. React uses a virtual DOM 

## Trigger a render
A component will render for two reasons: it's the initial render or the components or its father's component state has been updated. 

### Initial render
The initial render is done by calling the `createRoot` function targeting a DOM node, and then calling its `render` method. 1 grabs the elements, 2 is what actually is rendering the element.

```jsx
import Image from './Image.js';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root')) // 1
root.render(<Image />); // 2
```

On this initial render, React call the  `root` component and starts rendering all the components following the component tree recursively, if React encounters a child component it'll render that following a depth-first render; this means, React will fully render a branch of the tree before moving to sibling branches. In this process React use the `appendChild()` DOM API to create all nodes.

During the initial rendering React create the DOM nodes for the HTML elements. 

```jsx
function Root() {
  console.log('Rendering Root');
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <Main />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}

function Header() {
  console.log('Rendering Header');
  return <header>...</header>;
}

function Main() {
  console.log('Rendering Main');
  return (
    <main>
      <Article />
      <Sidebar />
    </main>
  );
}

function Article() {
  console.log('Rendering Article');
  return <article>...</article>;
}

function Sidebar() {
  console.log('Rendering Sidebar');
  return <aside>...</aside>;
}

function Footer() {
  console.log('Rendering Footer');
  return <footer>...</footer>;
}
```

In this example the console will log: "Rendering Root", "Rendering Header", "Rendering Main", "Rendering Article", "Rendering Sidebar", "Rendering Footer".
### When the state updates
Once the component has render for the first time, to trigger additional renders I have to use the `set` function of the [[22.12 useState and its elements|useState hook]], which will automatically que a new render.

## Rendering the component
**After** the initial render, if a new render is triggered (its state change), React calls the component function implementation, the entire body of the function is executed from top to bottom, local variables are initialized with their default values.

Trigger a render (even for the first render) is a recursive process, meaning if a component return other component, react will render that other component, and so on. The process continue until there are no more components and then React knows what to display. 

Once the initial render has created the DOM nodes for the HTML elements, but the re render process only calculate which properties have change (state, props, parent component). It won't do anything with that information until the commit phase. 

For re-renders, React will do the minimum to make the DOM match the latest rendering output. 
## React commits changes to the DOM
React only changes the DOM nodes (per HTML tag) **if thereâ€™s a difference** between renders. In this example, the component re-renders with a props passed from its parent every second. However, I can modify the input and the text doesn't disappear when the component re renders. Here React only updates the content of `<h1>`, but the `input` DOM node and its value remains the same, so React doesn't re-render it.

```jsx
export default function Clock({ time }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{time}</h1>
      <input />
    </>
  );
}
```
