[[12.12 React|React]]

- Multiple use effects within the same component is a good practice to keep things organized.
- Use this hook to execute things the component will need at some moment. 
- Bindings use within the dependency array will refresh its value every time the hook is used. In this example, the timer goes down once a key is pressed, but the console logs 60 a single time (the first two logs are for the strict mode, focus on the last console log).

```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    const gametime = setInterval(() => {
      if (timer > 0 && timerStart) {
        setTimer(prev => prev - 1)
      }
      if (timer === 0) {
        clearInterval(gametime)
        setGameStatus(false)
      }
    }, 1000)
    console.log(timer)

    return () => clearInterval(gametime)
  }, [timeStart])
```
 If I include the timer binding within the dependency array, timer will keep its state within every render of the hook.
