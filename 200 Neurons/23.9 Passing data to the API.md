[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

Data can be passed via query string parameters or request body. Applying binding source attributes tell the model binding engine where to find the binding source. There are several attributes, for an API the most use are from body, from query and from route.

For example, I can tell get city controller action the city if is coming from the route.

The `[ApiController]` attribute enables automatic binding source parameter inference.  ASP.NET Core automatically infers (deserialize) the binding source based on the parameter type (These rules will avoid identifying binding sources manually. ). For example,`[FromBody]` is inferred for complex type parameters, `[FromForm]` is not inferred to any simple or user-defined types.
