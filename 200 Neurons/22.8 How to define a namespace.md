[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

## Working with multiple classes

## Using qualifying names
The previous image use a single name space, but makes more sense to use sub name spaces, for example, that follows the directory structure.

>[!important]
>When using qualifying class names, the constructor, function or constant needs to have the qualify name. Either way, PHP will search for the class in the global space and not in the namespace.

>[!warning]
>I can put what ever name space I want, but is recommended and a standard to match name spaces with the folder structure. 

## Import class from the name space `use`
The second way is to import the class with the `use` keyword. In this case, detail when creating the object I don't have to write the full qualified namespace.

>`use` relief me of writing the namespace when using the class. 

>[!error]
>I can namespace constants and functions and import them, but this is not widely use.
>However, to do this, use the function keyword and replace `Transaction` with the function or constant name.

## USE OF `__DIR__`
I must use the DIR magic constant to prevent errors if the index.php file is rum from the command line.

## Qualified vs fully qualified name
- Fully qualified name: prefix by `\`, that indicates the full namespace to a class, function or constant. In this case, `\Notification\Email` is the full namespace to that class. Without the `\`, PHP will look for any import, `use`. If there is not an import statement, PHP by default will prepend the current name space to this qualified name.


- Qualified name: when using this, PHP will try to check if there is an import statement that resolves to notification namespace. In this case, I'm not importing something, so by default PHP will prepend the current namespace to the qualified name obtaining `PaymentGateway\Paddle\Notification\Email`, as seen in the error.
