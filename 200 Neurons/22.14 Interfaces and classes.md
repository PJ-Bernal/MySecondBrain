[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

Classes can implement interfaces to give a more detail and readable of what they objects must look like:

Making a class implements an interface could seem redundant, but is a good practice to enforce the class having the required methods and properties of the interface. 


Also, like method overloads, I can have classes with different implementations but a same interface.

```ts
interface Librarian {
  doWork: () => void;
}

class Ele implements Librarian {
  doWork() {
    console.log("Ele is working...");
  }
}

class AnotherLibrarian implements Librarian {
  doWork() {
    console.log("Another librarian is working...");
  }
}

function performTask(librarian: Librarian) {
  librarian.doWork();
}

const ele = new Ele();
const anotherLibrarian = new AnotherLibrarian();

performTask(ele); // "Ele is working..."
performTask(anotherLibrarian); // "Another librarian is working..."
```

## When creating an instance
When a class implements an interface, the class could have more methods and properties of what the interfaces does. In this case, I should think if the instance should the type of the class or the interface.

Now, if the class itself implements the interface, then all instance will be of that interface. This means, if the class has more properties/methods, F.
