[[13.1 OO Programming|OOP]]
[question:: Do subclasses inherit implementation from the superclasses]
[question:: private variables are inherit, but they are only accessible for the super classes?]
[question:: What exactly is polymorphism]

>Polymorphism happens when using inheritance, each object is able to respond/implement differently to the same method. The child can decide to implement the method like its parent, or decide to use a specific method implementation based on the execution.

This emerges the fundamental concept of polymorphism: it is the individual objectâ€™s responsibility to draw itself.

Following inheritance, all the subclasses inherit the interfaces from their superclass, however, each subclass is a separate entity and might require a separate response to a specific message. Therefor, the implementation of a method can be different from the parent class in the child class. 

Following [[23.1 Inheritance#^34e10a|this example]] I can't tell the user to draw a shape, what shape? It is an abstract concept.

Defining interfaces with no implementation is useful when having arrays, for example, having an array of Shapes (Circle, Square and Star) objects, when sending a draw message, the end result is different, they all have unique implementations. Each class is able to respond differently to the same draw method.

The key here is that the same message has been sent to the Shape class but different behaviors are being received.
>>This provides a standarization for the interface across classes

In classical OO, polymorphism is implemented with inheritance, both try to [[23.1 Inheritance#^34e10a|standardize]] messages across interfaces and the application. However, there is a way to implement polymorphism with composition. 

[question:: I understand the implementation should be done within every subclass, but what is the need to have a method with no implementation in the super class]
[question:: search abstract interfaces, methods]
[question:: re-write the fundamental concept to make a general statement]
[questoin:: What is override
[question:: use cases for abstract methods]
[question:: constructors with no return type and no this keyword?]
[question:: f a subclass inherits an abstract method from a superclass, it must provide a concrete implementation of that method, or else it will be an abstract class itse]
## Dynamic /run time polymorphism
Uses the same interface for methods on different types of objects, that may implement the methods in different ways.

Let's imagine a coffee maker class  with a method to brew (groundCoffee, water) coffee that is: put water and coffee. A French press can have the same brew method with the same inputs and outputs as the coffee maker (put water and add coffee). 

Detail how the two classes have the same inputs and output, but the way they brew is very different, and the attributes of the object could be different (the coffee with the French press is better than the machine one). 

Now, speaking about code, the French press could inherit all of the attributes and methods from the coffee maker, but then, it replaces the brew method with a process called overriding; this allows the French press to redefine its own method to brew coffee. 

![[Pasted image 20240108160035 1.png|center|250]]

The advantage of this kind of polymorphism is that it enables to use of any form of coffee maker as long as it has a brew method that takes coffee and water as inputs. For example, I've never seen 
or used one Nescafe machine before, but if it has a brew method, I can use it. 

Un summary, dynamic poly define different classes that can be used with the same interface. 

## Static /compile-time polymorphism
It uses the method overloading that allows to implement of multiple methods within a class with the same name, but a different set of input parameters. For example, I could use instead of coffee and water in the French press, leaves and water; thus, the press will execute a different version of the brew method. 

![[Pasted image 20240108160958 1.png|center|300]]

Two different methods, with two different signatures. In summary, static overloads a method from the same class that takes different set of parameters. 

## Example

Thanks to polymorphism, the loop is possible using the 'same' method.
