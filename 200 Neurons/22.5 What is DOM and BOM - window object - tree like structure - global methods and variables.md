## What is BOM
>[!blank-container|float-left-medium]
![[Pasted image 20240724150108.png]]

BOM or the Browser Object Model is a set of global objects provided automatically by the browser that allows interaction with the browser itself.; contrary to the DOM that "interacts" specifically with the HTML file.  

Its topmost object is the `window`, which is responsible for managing [[22.5 Scope - how it is defined - global, local, function, block scope - variable shadowing - scope chain - lexical scope - nested scope#Global scope|global scope]] variables, functions and objects.
>[!example|float-right-medium] Accessing global variables through the window interface
>````javascript
> let x = 10;
> var y = 20;
> const z = 30;
> t = 40;
>
> function test () {
>    let a = 100;
>    var b = 200;
>    const c = 300;
>    d = 400;
>}
>test();
>console.log(y); // 20  Same as console.log(window.y)
>console.log(t); // 40
>console.log(d); // 400
>console.log(isNan(3)); // false - Same as: console.log(window.isNaN(3));
>```

>[!example] Accessing a global variable through the window object
>[[22.5 var - variable and function hoisting with var -  var within the window object#var|var]] has either global or function scope, and undeclared variables have global scope; therefore only the `y`, `t` and `d` variables are accessible through the window object (the example is not using the `window.` syntax).

>The same happen with global methods like `parseInt()` or `isNaN()`

>[!important]
>To use a global property or method is not required to write `window` because the object is global.
>`window.console.log("test");`, is the same as `console.log("test");`

Most useful properties and methods of the `window` object:

>[!blank-container]
>- document #mcl/list-column

>- name

>- ScrollBy()
>- fetch()
>- addEventListener()

>- blut()
>- focus()
>- resizeTo()
>- moveBy()
>- moveTo()

>[!warning]- Window dialog stop the execution of the program
>Dialogs (prompt, alert, confirm) will stop processing at the point the method is called, until the user clicks OK or Cancel. This can cause problems if the program needs to process something else at the same time or the program is waiting for a callback function.

## What is the DOM
When a website is open, the browser retrieves the page's HTML text file, parses it and builds up a model document's structure use to render the website. The built document, is a **live data structure** of nodes (objects) to read or modify. 

>[!important]
>JavaScript does not alter your HTML file, but the built document, the DOM. The HTML file will look the same, but the JavaScript changes what the browser renders.

The interface to read or modify the live data structure of an HTML document is called the Document Object Model or DOM.

>Any HTML document can be seen as nested boxes represented by HTML tags and its content. In the DOM, the topmost object is `document`.

>**Each box** is an interactable object accessible through the global binding object `document`.

>[!warning|float-left-medium] Global depends on the context
>The `document` object is global in the sense that it is accessible from anywhere in your JavaScript code, but its properties and methods are not global in the way those of the window object are. So to see a property or use a method I will have to hardcode the `document` word always.
