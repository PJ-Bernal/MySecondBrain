## Live collection vs static collection
A live collection refers to an array-like live `HTMLcollection`. This is the return value of, for example, `getElementsByTagName()` and `getElementsByClassName()`. This collection is automatically updated. So, if the list of nodes change when looping, the indexes of the array-like list will change causing a bug. 

>[!important]
>- Because the collection is updated, is a good idea to make a copy using the `Array.from(HTML-collection)` method, to iterate to modify the nodes.
>- Because a list is return and some elements may contain `.` or `:` the `[ ]` is required to access each node. The HTML-collection is an array-like, so if I must use the [ ] if I want to select a specific element.

Because of that, when looping I have to do it from the end towards the beginning, this is because removing elements from the beginning of the list would change the indices of subsequent elements. 

Other query selectors like `querySelectorAll()` return a static `NodeList` of nodes, meaning any changes in the DOM don't affect the content of that array-like collection.
