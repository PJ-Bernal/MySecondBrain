[[12.12 React|React]]

React uses a virtual DOM to update the UI (is not the same as the actual DOM used by JS, this DOM is the actual structure of HTML elements); it's a lightweight JS object that mimics the structure of the real DOM and is kept in memory. This allow React to make changes without manipulating the actual DOM. 

This virtual DOM is NOT a copy of the real DOM, instead is created from scratch based entirely on my code components. So, each time a component's `render` methos is called, it returns a tree of React elements. 

```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

// This creates a root
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

// This renders your app and creates the initial virtual DOM
root.render(<App />);
```

This is what a virtual React DOM tree looks like. Is the virtual DOM's job to render JSX components to the DOM. 

```jsx
const ChildComponent = ({ name }) => {
  return <div className="child">Hello, {name}!</div>;
};

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div className="parent">
      <h2>Parent Component</h2>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <ChildComponent name="Alice" />
      <ChildComponent name="Bob" />
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <h1>React Component Tree Example</h1>
      <ParentComponent />
      <ParentComponent />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

The reconciliation algorithm uses two techniques to optimize updates:
- Tree diffing: when a component re-renders, it compares the current virtual DOM tree with the update version, identifying the minimum changes required to bring the virtual DOM in line with the updated state.
- Batching: React batches multiple changes into a single update, reducing the number of updates to the virtual DOM (and in consequence, to the real DOM).
