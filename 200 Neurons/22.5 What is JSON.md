[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

JSON formatting can be used independently from JS and other programming environments can parse and generate JSON files. A JSON file exists as a string, so it needs to be converted to a native JS object to access data in JS, by a process called deserialization (serialization is convert a native object to a string across the network).

Once a JSON file is parsed in JS I can use chain dot/bracket notation to access its properties. When accessing an array I have to use indexes.

Image I parse the JSON into a variable called `suuperHeroes`. 

```js
{
  "squadName": "Super hero squad",
  "homeTown": "Metro City",
  "formed": 2016,
  "secretBase": "Super tower",
  "active": true,
  "members": [
    {
      "name": "Molecule Man",
      "age": 29,
      "secretIdentity": "Dan Jukes",
      "powers": ["Radiation resistance", "Turning tiny", "Radiation blast"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Madame Uppercut",
      "age": 39,
      "secretIdentity": "Jane Wilson",
      "powers": [
        "Million tonne punch",
        "Damage resistance",
        "Superhuman reflexes"
      ]
    }
]

//For example
superHeroes["members"][1]["powers"][2];
```

## Arrays as JSON
Arrays can also be converted to/from JSON. 

```js
[
  {
    "name": "Molecule Man",
    "age": 29,
    "secretIdentity": "Dan Jukes",
    "powers": ["Radiation resistance", "Turning tiny", "Radiation blast"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Madame Uppercut",
    "age": 39,
    "secretIdentity": "Jane Wilson",
    "powers": [
      "Million tonne punch",
      "Damage resistance",
      "Superhuman reflexes"
    ]
  }
]

[0]["powers"][0]
```

## JSON conditions
- It only contains properties and values, not methods.
- Double quotes are required for properties and values.
- A single comma or misspelling can broke the JSON. [This](https://jsonlint.com/) is a JSON lint to check syntax.
