The controller should be in charge of handle the interaction between the user request and the repository, without adding implementing any business logic, therefore, its a good  practice to introduce a service layer between the repository and the controllers, that will handle that logic.

Some of this notes include some logic in the controllers, whereas that's not bad, is not entirely good if the application scale.

For that, create a services directory within the application one, and then create a class and its interface.

Now, this is the repo. This repo is using DTOs, and not direct entities.

In general, the same repo method will be in this service layer.

Then create the implementation of this layer, injecting the repo and adding what ever logic is required.

```c#
public class MyService : IMyService
{
    private readonly IMyRepository _repository;

    public MyService(IMyRepository repository)
    {
        _repository = repository;
    }

    public async Task CreateAsync(MyEntity entity)
    {
        // Add business logic here
        await _repository.AddAsync(entity);
    }

    public async Task UpdateAsync(MyEntity entity)
    {
        // Add business logic here
        await _repository.UpdateAsync(entity);
    }

    public async Task DeleteAsync(int id)
    {
        // Add business logic here
        await _repository.DeleteAsync(id);
    }
}
```

Then register the new layer as a singleton.

After that, go to the controller and inject the layer.
