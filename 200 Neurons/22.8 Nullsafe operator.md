[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

This operator allows to chain properties and method calls even if one of them returns null.  

Having the following classes.

![[Pasted image 20240312210806.png|center]]
![[Pasted image 20240312210902.png|center]]

And the main script. Here I want to access the property id. In this example the code is chaining attributes of different classes unless it reaches the id attribute.

But what if I create a customer object like in the second line, an error will appear.

So I can chain the nullsafe operator.

## Using null coalescing operator
I have to be careful because the null coalescing operator works only with attributes, not with method calls. 

![[Pasted image 20240312212351.png]]

But what if I change the properties for methods, so now my properties are private and my classes have getters.

![[Pasted image 20240312212625.png]]

Now this won't work because null coalescing don't work with method calls.

How ever, using the nullsafe operator I can use the null coalescing operator. 

![[Pasted image 20240312212750.png]]

There is no error ![[Pasted image 20240312212803.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240312212830.png]] The code like this will echo null and null is empty string. 

## Without using the nullsafe operator
Nested if statements will be required.

## How does the nullsafe operator actually work?
It short-circuit the property or method access, returning null immediately as soon as it's null without executing the rest of the expression.

In this example, [here](![[Pasted image 20240312212830.png]]), If the getCustomer method returns null (which it does in this case), everything on the right side will get discarded. 

Ig getcustomer returns a value, but getpaymentprofile, the id is discarded. 
## Things to be aware
1. I can't assign values to it.

![[Pasted image 20240312213421.png]]

2. Be aware to chain important function if they must be executed, because as soon as the chain short circuit, they won't be executed. Remember the nullsafe will short circuit as soon as the null value is encountered. 

![[Pasted image 20240312213540.png]]
If get customer returns null, then the create profile function never runs. But, what if create profile MUST run regardless of what happen in the chain? 

Then I have to assign the method to a variable in a code line above the chain, and then pass the variable as the argument for setpaymentprofile. 

**However** if the createprofile is very expensive I might not want to run it unless the get customer is null. 
## What if no nullsfae is used?
If I decide not to use the nullsafe operator, I'll have to nest a bunch of if conditionals.
