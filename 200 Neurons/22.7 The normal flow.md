Elements on a webpage lay out in normal flow if no CSS is applied to change the way they behave. Its behave can change adjusting the position in the normal flow or removing them from it. 

>Normal flow is designed to make readable documents, thus, I should work with the normal flow, not against it over-changing the layout.

## How elements laid out by default?
First, padding, border and margin is added to the content box, producing the box model for each box. Then, each box follows the standard inline and block behavior. In the normal flow, the width and height are hard constraints. 

Then, the normal layout appears as it dictates how elements are placed inside the browser's viewport. By default, block boxes are laid out in the block flow direction (one element per line) which is based on the parent's `writing-mode` property whose default value is `horizontal-tb`.

Then, Inline elements will sit along in the same line with any text content beside if there is enough space, if not, the content will move down to a new line. 

Margin collapses for block elements.
