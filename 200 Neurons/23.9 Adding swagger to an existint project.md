# Define a document created with swagger
Install the swashbuckle nu get package, then register the service and configure the open api specification with swagger doc method.

Then pass a name to the open api specification and then, using targe-type new declarations, I don't need to put the class name `Microsoft.OpenApi.Models.OpenApiInfo()`, to create an object when its already known.

I can add several fields here, not only title and version.

Then add swagger to the request pipeline.

# Testing
Up to this point, no UI has been generated, meaning, to see the open api specification, I need to /swagger/name of my api.
