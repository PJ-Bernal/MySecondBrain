Parameter that can be set to `development`, `production` or `none` to let webpack know what kind of environment I'm building. Thus, webpack automatically apply certain built-in optimizations based on the set mode.  Its default value is production. Know the details of this optimizations is not required. 

```js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'production',
};
```

## webpack.dev and webpack.prod
To avoid editing the when switching between production and development I might have **two** webpack configuration files: `webpack.prod.js` and `webpack.dev.js`. 

>If `--config` is omitted, webpack will search for the `webpack.config.js` by default. 

```json
// webpack.prod.js
"build": "webpack --config webpack.prod.js",
```


```js
// webpack.dev.js
"dev": "webpack serve --config webpack.dev.js"
```

## Webpack merge
This utility allow to have a common webpack configuration file for the production and development configuration files, to keep things DRY. First, install `npm install --save-dev webpack-merge`, and then create the configuration files (`webpack.common.js`, `webpack.dev.js`, `webpack.prod.js`).



```js
// webpack.common.js
const path = require('path');
 const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

 module.exports = {
   entry: {
     app: './src/index.js',
   },
   plugins: [
     new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
       title: 'Production',
     }),
   ],
   output: {
     filename: '[name].bundle.js',
     path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
     clean: true,
   },
 };
```

>[!warning]
>I must add the `merge( )` calls in the development and production configuration files to include the common configuration file. 

```js
// webpack.dev.js
 const { merge } = require('webpack-merge');
 const common = require('./webpack.common.js');

 module.exports = merge(common, {
   mode: 'development',
   devtool: 'inline-source-map',
   devServer: {
     static: './dist',
   },
 });
```

```js
// webpack.prod.js
 const { merge } = require('webpack-merge');
 const common = require('./webpack.common.js');

 module.exports = merge(common, {
   mode: 'production',
 });
```

>[!important] 
>>Inside of common.js
>>I have to set up the `entry` and `output` properties, and any plugin require for both environments. 
>
>>Inside of dev.js
>>Change the `mode` to `development`. Added a recommended `devtool` and a `devServer`
