# Resource name guidelines
When creating a resource some best practices are required:
- Noun: the resource name should be a noun, not an action. The URI should refer to a resource that is a thing. The noun gives meaning to the resource. Remember to **pluralize** a noun, unless the URI match a single resource. 
- The action over the resource is defined by the HTTP method and not the resource name. This is bad: `api/getauthors`, this is better `api/authors` that can use a GET method.

- The URI must describe hierarchy clearly.
- Filtering, sorting, order aren't resources. They are parameters pass via query string. This is bad: `api/authors/orderby/name`.
- A plural noun should be followed by an id, and not another word: `api/authors/{authorid}`.

>[!important]
>RPC-style calls don't easily map to pluralized resource names, this example: `api/authors/{authorid}/pagetotals` is this going to return a collection of pages? or the total number of pages.

>Pluralized nouns is not the best answer in this case. Is better: `api/authorpagetotals/{id}`, this is better. But another approach is valid: `api/authors/{authorid}/totalamountofpages`

>They key here is, when requesting a single thing, the URI must end in a noun in singular not in plural.
