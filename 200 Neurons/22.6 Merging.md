## What is merging / how to merge
Merge refers to the act of joining two branches (whatever they are). Conflicts happen when Git detects an alteration of code in the same line of the same file in two different branches. 

Is a good practice to delete a branch when the merge has occurred. 
### Fast forward
>[!info|float-right-small]-
>![[Pasted image 20240104185959 1.png]]

When a branch merges with the main branch that hasn't been modified at all. It's the best-case scenario, it doesn't represent any conflict. 

Detail how the HEAD positions at the last commit of the 'new branch' after merging.

>When a commit happens on another branch, the log should show the HEAD on the branch and the master is one commit below. 

Once the feature branch is finished with all the changes, _to merge the HEAD must be located in the branch that is waiting to receive those changes_, in this case, the main branch. Finally, use the `git merge 'feature branch name` command.

### Automatic / recursive - ort merge
Similar to the fast-forward merge, but, the main branch did have alterations that didn't interfere with the new branch. The merge is done as normal if the same lines of code weren't modify in both branches.

In this example, the main and the external branches had committed, detail two changes that happened on the 'ramav' branch and one on the main branch. Again, the HEAD must be on the branch that is expecting the changes.

### Manual merge
This happens while in the merge Git detects code that gets affected between the main branch and the new branch (lines of code in the new branch affect code in the main branch). Thus, Git will require a manual comparison of the two commits to generate a new commit named 'merge commit.'

>![[Pasted image 20240104191302 1.png|center|350]]

The main and the external branches have different code in the same line. The files without conflicts get commit right away.

>The same line of code (3) within the  'missions' file was modified in the master and the 'rama-conflicto' branch, thus Git open the conflicted file (this is not a new file, is the actual real file) and modifies it.

>>Detail how the file totally change and now has '<<<HEAD', the two comparing lines, etc. The file can't stay like that so the conflict must be resolve.

>VSCode support had the four options but doing this manually is recommended. 

Manage the conflict is either editing the conflict file as desired or using one of VSCode options. _Is a good custom to resolve all the conflicted files before creating code or making a new commitment._ Finally, a commitment is required.

### What is HEAD? How to change branches
HEAD points to the actual branch, so all new commits will be added to that branch. I'm located in. So, after a branch is created, `git checkout 'branch name'` will relocate the HEAD to the new branch.
