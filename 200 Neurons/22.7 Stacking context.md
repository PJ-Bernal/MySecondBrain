## What is the stacking context
Layer that group several HTML elements along an imaginary z-axis plane relative to the user. By default, a plain HTML document will have a single stacking context that encompasses all nodes. Also, it determines the order in which elements are rendered (painted) on the screen when they overlap.

The stacking context position of an element is controlled by the z index value. 

**[This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Understanding_z-index/Stacking_context)** rules create a stacking context. Elements also arranges in certain order depending on those rules. But the most common way of create a stacking context is:
-  `position:` with anything other than `static` and `z-index: #`.  ^6a8a58
- `opacity` to less than 1.
- `position` values to `fixed` or `sticky` no require a `z-index` value.
- Adding a `z-index` value to a flexbox or grid element.
- Use `transform`, `filter`, `clip-path` or `perspective`.

In this example every element has its own context because their positioning and z index values.
 
The elements 4, 5 and 6 have their own context within 3, therefore, their stacking context is only valid within 3, and don't relate with context outside of 3.

DIV #4's z-index (6) is valid within the stacking context of DIV #3. So, DIV #4 is under DIV #1, because DIV#3's z-index is 4 and DIV #1 is 5. 


To visualize stacking easier, append the context parent to its children z index, so, div #4 z index is 4.6, div #5 z index is 4.1 and so on.

>- Stacking context can container other stacking context, they are independent of its siblings. 
>- Elements within different static context don't interact directly, only their parents do. For example if div 4 would have a z index of 1000, the div 1 would still be on top of it.

This affects transition performance directly because if a transition element have several stacking contexts on the top, the browser also have to pain that is stacked on the top of the current element.

For a better performance, try to use only the opacity and transform rules when making a transition. 

## Using z index
Using z index on a element don't create a stacking context directly. In reality, all children elements of the context are "in one plane" regardless if they have different z index values. 

## Main stacking context
I didn't understand this.
