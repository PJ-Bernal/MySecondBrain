[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]
There are four statements to include files: `include`, `require`, `include_once` and `require_once`. Using any statement result in the evaluation of the file's content.
## include vs require
Include could result in a warning and require could result in an error and stop the application. 

>[!info]
>Detail an error was generated, but the application continues its execution. 
>![[Pasted image 20240307224807.png|center|450]]

>[!important] File's path
If no path is specified, PHP will search by default from the directory that set in the PHP.ini configuration file, under the ‘include_path’ section. If the file don’t exist on that directory it will look for the file in the current directory of the current script. In the case of the image, the current script is looking for the file.php file within the same directoy as the current script. 

## require_once vs include_once
Work the same as require and include but they will include the file if it hasn’t been included already (this mean I can include it several times the same file). 

>[!important]
>Detail in the image, the file was included twice, so that script is being and executed twice, so two ‘Hello from file’ are printed.
>
>![[Pasted image 20240307225044.png|center|450]]
>But using require_once, the file is executed once even if it's called multiple times.

## Variables of included files
When a file is included or required, the variables can be used on that new file. 

>[!important]
>This is a big difference when using `_once` or not.

>[!info]
>In this case, the file is required once, so when is echoed for the second time, it holds the recent update value of 6 (the original value was 5).
>

>[!info]
> 
Now, when using require, detail the second require call once again the original file in which the variable value was 5. So the second require, override the variable $x++, to 5 again.

So, files with important functions or declarations, I might want to use the `require_once` to avoid function redeclaration errors or variable overriding values like the example. 

However there is a good use for include and required that is when files contain helper scripts or repetitive functions I want to use 'fresh' variables. 

>I can modified a value in the main script and modified on another file but this is not a good practice. 
## Return value of include and require
>[!multi-column]
>
>When treating the include as a expression, using either include or require will return a default value of one if the file exists or false if not. Additionally, the file will be still evaluated (and that is why something is print in the browser). Detail the content is imported (`$x++;`) and then modified to obtain `6` and now, thanks to the expression I can use the `int(1)` if I want.

Now, when the file has return statement, it will return what that return returns (not one or false). In this case, the file.php has a return code like `return [1, 2, 3];` This is very handy when working with configuration files.

## Using include within HTML for code re-usabilty
>[!multi-column]
>
>When multiple PHP pages  share something, for example the same title or content, is not practical to manually change that in all pages (100 pages = 100 manual adjustments). Therefore, I can extract that common parts within a PHP file and simply call that file within all HTML files.

>![[Pasted image 20240307234512.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>
>Foe example, the home, about and contact page share the same navigation bar, therefore I can take that element tag, create a PHP file and include that file within each HTML file.
>
>![[Pasted image 20240307234611.png]]

>If a warning appears when including the file (failed to open stream), most likely the path file is wrong. 

>[!important]
>This is extremely useful as any change to the php file will be reflected directly on each HTML file that include that file. 

## Convert PHP file to string using output functions
>[!multi-column]
>
>The result of treating the include/require as a expression is either `int(1)`, `bool(false)` or return. If I want to obtain all the file's **_parsed_** code as a string use the code in the image.
>
>![[Pasted image 20240308084959.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>
>Detail nothing is printed in the browser and because the included file is not being evaluated but assigned to a variable. To print I must echo the variable. 
>
>![[Pasted image 20240308085410.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>
>Because the `ob_get_clean()` returns the evaluated content of the file as a string I can manipulate the parsed code like this.
