Class properties are another way to add properties (of any data type) to an object instance, thus, the property will be always there acting as a "default" property. 

Class properties act like stickers, once I create the object, I put the sticker and I "can't" remove it (or modify), because is going to left a stain. 

In the other hand, constructors act as a piece of whiteboard attached to the object with an erasable market, meaning the property can be modified.

Though I can modify class properties at any time, once the objects are created, that update is not reflect in the object, the sticker is already there. 

Now, like regular prototype inheritance, the objects get a copy of the class property/constructor property. So, modify any of those two won't affect an instantiated object, unless I modify the `prototype` of the class(?)

If I want my objects to have a default value and at the same time be able to modify that value in the future, I can use class properties and constructors. Imagine this like attaching that whiteboard and the marker, to each object; the property can be modify, but each object have a copy, not a reference to that property. 

```js
class User {
  name = "Anonymous"; // Default value

  constructor(name) {
    if (name) {
      this.name = name; // Override default if provided
    }
  }

  sayHi() {
    alert(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
  }
}

const user1 = new User(); // Uses default "Anonymous"
const user2 = new User("Alice"); // Uses provided name "Alice"

// Another example
class Rectangle {
  height = 0;
  width;
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}
```

## Class properties accessibility inside the class
>[!important]
>All class properties are added to the objects before the constructor runs, therefore, within  my constructor I can use class properties

```js
class Test {
    counter = 0;
    constructor () {
        this.counter+=1;
        console.log(`${this.counter}`);}}
const test1 = new Test();
// 1
```

## Class properties are added one by one
Class properties are added one-by-one, and properties can use each other. 

```js
class C {
  a = 1;
  b = this.c;
  c = this.a + 1;
  d = this.c + 1;
}

const instance = new C();
console.log(instance.d); // 3
console.log(instance.b); // undefined
```

## This in class properties
`this` refers to the class properties, not the object (at this point I don't even have an object).

```js
class Base {
  baseField = "base field";
  anotherBaseField = this.baseField;
  baseMethod() {
    return "base method output";
  }
}

console.log(base.anotherBaseField); // "base field"
```
