# About interfaces in TS
Interfaces define a type (the shape) for an object, class or method return type, creating a contract through a collection of properties and methods, defining how the type can and can't be used. They don't compile to anything in TS. 

The interface only includes the shape, it doesn't provide any implementation. 

## Duck typing and interfaces
Interfaces imply duck typing, meaning, if an object has the shape of an interface (it has the same properties and methods declared in the interface), TS will assume the object is of that type, even if it wasn't explicitly type to that type.

```ts
interface Duck{
  age: number;
  swim: () => void;
  quack: () => void;
}

// Detail I neven type this variable as :Duck
let probablyADuck = {
  age = 5,
  swim: () => console.log('swimming like a duck'),
  quack: () => console.log('quacking like a duck'), 
}

function FLyLikeADuck(bird: Duck){// some implementation}

FLyLikeADuck(probablyADuck)
```
