[[13.3 Clean code]]

Clean code makes code more readable for others and myself for future reference. For example, Single characters can be used as variable names in the context of a loop or a callback function, but avoid them elsewhere, like in this example of bad code.

```javascript

const x = function (z) {
  const w = "Hello ";
return w + z
};

x("John");
```
