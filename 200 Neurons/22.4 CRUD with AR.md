The stungeye notes code have more examples and details of each one of those. Also, I can write this CRUD commands in a script file and execute them using ruby filename.rb or I can execute one by one in the irb. 

>Be mindful when creating, I'm creating objects (instances) of the models, the classes, that represent a table in AR. Also, when I create an object it is NOT in the table, but my script, so I have to save it in order to include it to the table.

>When reading, I can create instances of the classes that represent a single row from that table. To access the attributes of a record (an instance) AR provide two syntaxes, the dot and the hash syntax. The dot notation is possible because >AR dynamically defines getter and setter methods for each column in the model. The hash syntax is possible because how AR holds the model's attributes. 

## Create
```ruby
load 'ar.rb'

# CREATING WITH ACTIVE RECORD

# There are three ways to create and persist a new Customer.
# Warning: If you run this script multiple times you will
# end up with duplicate entries in your customers table.

# Method One: Create a Customer in "object space".

new_customer = Customer.new

# Set the required properties.

new_customer.name  = "Kyle Geske"
new_customer.email = "kgeske@rrc.ca"
new_customer.city  = "Winnipeg"

# Calling save on the object will persist it to the customers table.

new_customer.save

# We can call inspect on any object to inspect its internals.

puts new_customer.inspect


# Method Two: Create an Customer in "object space"

# This time we set the required properties as key/value arguments of the new method.
# Detail this notation means both name and wally gluton are symbols. 

wally = Customer.new( name:  "Wally Glutton",
                      email: "wglutton@mailinator.com",
                      city:  "Winnipeg" )

# Like the previous example we need to call save to persist the object
# to the customers table.

wally.save

# Method Three: Create the object and persist it all at once. Using create will do the save once the line is executed. 

jane = Customer.create( name:  "Jane Smith",
                        email: "jsmith@mailinator.com",
                        city:  "Winnipeg" )

# Let's test the validations we added to the models/customer.rb file:
# validates_presence_of :name, :email, :city

bobby = Customer.new( name: "Bobby McGee" ) # Purposefully missing the city and email.

# Save will return false if any of our validations fail.
if (bobby.save)
  puts "Bobby was saved to the database customers table."
  puts bobby.inspect
else
  puts "There was an error saving bobby to the database."
  
  # We can loop through all the validation errors.
  bobby.errors.messages.each do |column, errors|
    errors.each do |error|
      puts "The #{column} property #{error}."
    end
  end
end
```
## Delete
```ruby
load 'ar.rb'

# DELETING ROWS WITH ACTIVE RECORD

# Let's find a customer in our customers table.
#
# You will need to run the active_record_create.rb script
# first, otherwise this customer will not exist.

kyle = Customer.where(:name => 'Kyle Geske').first

# In the above statement we have to call .first to get a single
# customer object. Without the .first we will get a collection
# of objects. In this case it will likely be a collection of
# size 1.

puts kyle.inspect

# Deleting the customer is as simple as calling .destroy

kyle.destroy  unless kyle.nil?

puts kyle.inspect

# DANGER! The following commented command would delete *all* customers
# from the customers table.

# Customer.destroy_all
```
## Read
Generally speaking, the results of any read line of code will be a hash. 

```ruby
load 'ar.rb'

# READING DB ROWS WITH ACTIVE RECORD

# We can call .count on the Customer class to count all the rows.
# This will generate the following SQL:
# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;

number_of_customers = Customer.count
puts "There are #{number_of_customers} in my customers table."

# To load-up all rows from our customers table we call .all.

all_customers = Customer.all

# The all_customers object acts like an array.

puts "Based on customers collection there are #{all_customers.size} customers."
puts "The first customer is #{all_customers[0].inspect}"

# Who is the first customer by primary key?
# Unlike .all which returns a collection of Customer objects,
# .first returns a single Customer object.

first_customer = Customer.first

# We can access this customer's columns/properties in two ways:

puts "The name of my first customer is #{first_customer[:name]}."
puts "The first customer's city is #{first_customer.city}."

# Who is the last customer by primary key?

last_customer = Customer.last
puts last_customer.name

# We can simulate SQL WHERE clauses with the .where method.
# Exact matches can be found as follows:
# Detail argument of where is a hash, where city is a symbol and Winnipeg a value, In this case the code is using the short hand when the key is a symbol that is key: 'value' instead of :key => 'value'

winnipeg_customers = Customer.where(city: 'Winnipeg')

# The where method can also take a string argument.

customers_with_a_names = Customer.where('name LIKE "a%"')

# We can also chain other SQL clauses onto our searches.
# Here we're ordering our results by city and limiting to 5 rows.

five_customers_with_a_names = Customer.where('name LIKE "a%"').order(:city).limit(5)
five_customers_with_a_names.each { |c| puts c.name }

puts "Number of Winnipeg customers is #{winnipeg_customers.size}"

# If we know the primary key we can search for it directly with find.

customer_by_id = Customer.find(9000)

puts customer_by_id.inspect

# If you want to find the first instance of a record that matches a where clause,
# use find_by. Similar to where, but returns a single object instead of a collection.

customer = Customer.find_by('name LIKE "a%"')
puts customer.name

customer = Customer.find_by(city: 'Winnipeg')
puts customer.inspect
```
## Update
```ruby
load 'ar.rb'

# UPDATING ROWS WITH ACTIVE RECORD

# Find a customer by primary key.

customer_by_id = Customer.find(9000)

puts customer_by_id.inspect

# Change the customer's city in object space.

customer_by_id.city = ""

puts customer_by_id.inspect

# The associated row in the customers table will not change until
# we save the object.

if (customer_by_id.save)
  puts "The customer was updated."
else
  puts "There was a validation error when saving the customer."
end

# Let's find 5 specific customers...

five_customers_with_a_names = Customer.where('name LIKE "a%"').order(:city).limit(5)

# ...and change all their city column/properties to Winnipeg.

five_customers_with_a_names.each do |c|
  c.city = "Winnipeg"
  c.save
end

# The above will fire off one SQL UPDATE for each record. You can update all in
# one SQL statement using the more efficient update_all:

winnipeggers = Customer.where(city: 'Winnipeg')

# Moving all customers to Winterpeg:

winnipeggers.update_all(city: 'Winterpeg')
```
