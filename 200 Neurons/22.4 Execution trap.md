[[13 Programming]]

Ssoftware-produce synchronous ^[when multiple processes join at a certain point, the execution of each operation depends on completing the one before it; each task requires an answer before moving to the next] interruption in the user space process triggered by an exception (invalid memory access, division by zero, breakpoint or the process attempt to execute a privileged action) that _interrupts the user process_, performs a context switching to kernel mode (giving more priority to this) and as the system call is completed following a trap handler, the OS resume and continue the execution to the user process.

The trap is reported immediately and follows specific trap instructions (trap handler: code that runs when the trap is triggered such as terminating the process or performing a privileged action), allowing the continuity of the user process with no interruptions. 

Is not the user process that jumps to kernel mode, the process is interrupted and resumes once the trap handler has finished. 

The execution is the interruption, but the [[22.4 System call interface|System call interface]] is the request that triggers the interruption, etc.
