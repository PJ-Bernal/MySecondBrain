[[12.12 React|React]]

Hooks are functions (that are only available while React is rendering) to use React specific features. All use the prefix `use`. Two main rules:
1. Hooks can't be called from inside loops, conditions or other nested functions.  
2. Hooks should be called inside a function component or custom hooks. 
3. Hooks should be called in the same order on every render.

React relies on the order of hook calls to correctly preserve the state between renders. 

```jsx
function ExampleComponent({ initialCount, userData }) {
  // This is fine - accessing props before hooks
  const userGreeting = `Hello, ${userData.name}`;

  // These hooks are at the top level, even though they're not the first lines
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count]);

  // This is also acceptable
  const [userState, setUserState] = useState(userData);

  // ... rest of the component logic ...

  return (
    // JSX
  );
}
```

Hooks executes the same way the are hard-coded.
