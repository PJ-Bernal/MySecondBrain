[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

## Adding CSS to HTML
```html
<head>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/StyleSheetName.css" media="screen, print">
</head>
```

The link tag must be within the head element. `href` attribute must contain the path/URL, absolute (like: http://example.com/sheet1.css) or relative, to the CSS style sheet file. `rel` indicates the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file. `type="text/css"` attribute is no longer require within link. 

Each stylesheet added to the HTML will require a link element. 

## Inline CSS
Is not recommended because it overwrites the stylesheet imported and it can clump easily the document with properties.
