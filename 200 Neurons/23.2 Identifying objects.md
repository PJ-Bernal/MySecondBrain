[[13.2 Project management]]

Once the analysis has been done and the requirements gathered, the next step is to create a conceptual model that represents the most important objects in the application and the relation ship between them. This process is known as the noun analysis. 

>[!warning]
>On this stage, object is not referred to OOP, but things in the application that I need to be aware of. Not everything here will become a class. 

In theory, all the nouns represent information that must be represented and accounted for, in code. Thus, a noun that has a collection of related information becomes a class, as the related information becomes attributes.

## What makes it a class?
An actor uses the system, it isn't a class unless I have to store or retrieve information about it. A noun becomes a class if it has 1 or more attributes or actions.
## How to identify objects?
### Gather all nouns from analysis  
Review all use cases and user stories and other requirements to pick up all of the nouns. If the nouns are not the best or I find some minor problem in the analysis done, don't waste time trying to make corrections in this stage.

### Identify obvious duplicates
Identify obvious duplicates within the list of all nouns. I can split, delete or identify if some nouns works better as ''characteristics' of others.

>In this case it is deleted as it vague and not clear; also it refers to the asteroid, and asteroid is already included; if it hadn't been included, I would have had to include. 
>%% %%
>Also, offscreen is deleted as it's part of the concept of area, it could be an attribute. 
>%% %%
>System is also removed, aswell if a noun represents the system. 

>[!warning]
>If I doubt, in this stage, if a noun should be object I can keep it on the list. Identifying objects analysis don't focus on implementation, attributes, methods or classes. Changes can be made later. 

The end product is a list of nouns with a rectangle on it, and this is the beginning of the conceptual model.

A way to clasify better what a noun should represent is to use a grid, see last section of the note. 

### Simple over complex
Some nouns should sounds so complex that diserves an own class, however, keep things easy and simple is a better way to handle a robus desing. There is no need to create a complex class if I can break into several classes.
## Identifying class relationships
Relate objects with line between its boxes, and, thouhg is not required, use words could ease relations lecture as the relations 1:1, 1:* etc.

## How to identify attributes?
I have to determine how important is that noun. A noun is an attribute of another noun if it belongs to it or helps describe that noun. A noun with attributes becomes automatically in a class.

Once you discover a noun is a class that does not mean it's no longer an attribute of another class. An attribute that has a class type is how you connect one class to the other.
