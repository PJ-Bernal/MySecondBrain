[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

## While

The condition is check first, and only if its true, the code block gets executed. If the first check is false, the code block is never executed. 

>[!important] Use case for while
>
>>[!multi-column]
>>
>>`While` is handy to create infinite loops (using true as the condition) for a use case in which the application is waiting for something to happen and then break out of the loop with a break statement.
>>
>>```PHP
>>$i = 0;
>>while(true){
>>    if ($i >= 15){
>>        break;
>>    }
>>    echo $i++;
>>}
>>//01234567891011121314

### Break nested `while`
>[!multi-column]
>
>Break has a numeric argument (by default is set to one), to indicate how many loops are going to be broken. This is useful when having nested loops.  
>%% %%
>Here, the two while loops are going to be broken when the `$i >10` is false.
>
>```PHP
>$i = 0;
>while(true){
>	while($i > 10){
>        break 2;
>    }
>echo $i++;
>}
>//012345678910

>Using `break`, without any number, in the previous example will keep the code within the first loop. 

### Alternate syntax
Embed a while loop within HTML should be done like this.

```PHP
$i = 0;
while($i <= 15): // no curly brace
	if($i % 2 == 0){
		continue;
    }
echo i++;
endwhile; // no curly brace
```
This way of embed PHP within HTML is kind similar the one [[22.8 Control structures|if]] uses. 
## Continue statement
>[!multi-column]
>
>Use to skip the current loop iteration and go to the next one, therefore, all the code below the `continue` won't be executed. As the `break`, `continue` could have an integer number as parameter to skip multiple nested loops. 
>%% %%
>The following code will create an infinite loop because the `echo $i++` code is skip and the interpreter goes over `while($i <= 15)`
>
>```PHP
>$i = 0;
>while($i <= 15){
>	if($i % 2 == 0){
>		continue;
>    }
>echo i++;
>}


>[!multi-column]
>
>To solve this, the increment should be done before the if conditional or above the continue code line. 
>%% %%
>In this code the if statement is ""not needed"" because the increases are done by two in each iteration. But the logic is missing without the if statement. 
>
>```PHP
>$i = 0;
>while($i <= 15){
>	$i++; 
>	if($i % 2 == 0){
>		continue;
>    }
>echo $i++ . '.';
>}
>// 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15


## Do-while
>[!multi-column]
>
>Similar to while but the code block will be executed at least once (regardless if the condition is false), because the conditional statement is checked at the end of the iteration. 
>
>```PHP
>$i = 0;
>do {
>	echo $i++;
>} while ($i <= 10);

## For
>[!multi-column]
>
>For loop takes three expressions (that could contain multiple expressions) separated by semicolons (all three are not required). The first expression only evaluates the first time, the second is the conditional that is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration. And the last expression is evaluated at the end of each iteration. 
>
>```PHP
>for($i = 0; $i < 5; print $i, $i++){
>}
>// 01234
>for($i = 0; print $i, $i < 5;  $i++){
>}
>// 012345

>[!important]
>If the conditional expression contain multiple expressions, the evaluation whether a loop should continue or not will be determined by the last expression. 
>
>This is why on the second for loop, the last number is 5 and not 4. 

### Alternate syntax
```PHP
for($i = 0; print $i, $i < 5;  $i++):
	// Some code here
endfor;
```
## For each
Use to iterate over arrays or objects. Every iteration assigns each value of the array to a new variable. Using foreach on something different as an array or object will produce an error. 

```PHP
$array = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'hippo'];
foreach($array as $auxvar1){
	echo $auxvar1 . ', ';
}
//dog, cat, bird, hippo
```

The keys are also accessible.

```PHP
$array = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'hippo'];
foreach($array as $keyvar1 => $auxvar2){
	echo $auxvar1 . ', ' . $auxvar2 . ', ';
}
echo '<br />' . $auxvar1 . ', ' . $auxvar2;
// 0, dog, 1, cat, 2, bird, 3, hippo,
// 3, hippo
```

>[!important]
>Both auxiliary variables (for the keys and values) are created in the foreach loop and they hold the last array key/value pair; they **are not destroyed** after the loop ends!!

### Using reference variables
By default, the arrays' values are assigned by value (the examples above), but they can be assign by reference. 

```PHP
$array = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'hippo'];
foreach($array as $auxvar1 => &$auxvar2){
	$auxvar2 = 'php';
	//echo $auxvar1 . ', ' . $auxvar2 . ', ';
}
print_r($array);// Array ( [0] => php [1] => php [2] => php [3] => php [4] => php )
```

>[!danger] If I decide to use reference variables
>Detail, when using a reference variable, the last value of the array is 'linked' to the reference variable, thus, if it gets modified after the foreach loop, so does the array. 
>```PHP
>$array = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'hippo'];
>foreach($array as $auxvar1 => &$auxvar2){
>    echo $auxvar1 . ', ' . $auxvar2  . ', ';
}
print_r($array); // Array ( [0] => dog [1] => cat [2] => bird [3] => hippo ) // reference variable hasn't been modified up to this point
$auxvar2 = 'php';
print_r($array); // Array ( [0] => dog [1] => cat [2] => bird [3] => php ) // last elemet from hippo to php
echo '<br />' . $auxvar1 . ', ' . $auxvar2; // 3, php 

>[!solution]
A recommendation is, if the reference variable is used within the foreach, after the loop use the `unset()` function to detached of the variable from the array.  
>```PHP
>$array = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'hippo'];
>foreach($array as $auxvar1 => &$auxvar2){
>    echo $auxvar1 . ', ' . $auxvar2  . ', ';
}
>unset($auxvar2);
>$auxvar2 = 'php'
>print_r($array); // Array ( [0] => dog [1] => cat [2] => bird [3] => hippo ) // Array is not affected

## Iterate over hashes
Using for each over associative arrays will produce an error.

![[Pasted image 20240408201859.png|center|500]]

To avoid this, I can use the `json.encode()`, `implode()` only if I'm looping an array, or iterate over the value creating a nested foreach loop. 

```PHP
$array = [
	'name' => 'Pablo',
	'game' => 'MHWIB',
	'weapons' => ['switchaxe', 'great sword', 'glaive insect'],
];

//First method
foreach($array as $auxvar1 => &$auxvar2){
    echo $auxvar1 . ': ' . json_encode($auxvar2)  . '<br /> ';
}

//First method
foreach($array as $auxvar1 => &$auxvar2){
	if(is_array($auxvar2)){
		$auxvar2 = implode(',' . $auxvar2);
	}
	echo $auxvar1 . ': ' . json_encode($auxvar2)  . '<br /> ';
}

//First method
foreach($array as $auxvar1 => &$auxvar2){
    echo $auxvar1 . ': ';
        
    if(is_array($auxvar2)){
        foreach($auxvar2 as $weapons) {
            echo $weapons . ' - ';
        }
    } else {
        echo $auxvar2;
    }
echo '<br />';
}
```

### Alternate syntax
```PHP
foreach($array as $auxvar1 => &$auxvar2):
    echo $auxvar1 . ': ';
        
    if(is_array($auxvar2)){
        foreach($auxvar2 as $weapons) {
            echo $weapons . ' - ';
        }
    } else {
        echo $auxvar2;
    }
echo '<br />';
endforeach;
```
## Performance issue
Functions can be called within the conditional expression, but calling a function several times can be a performance issue. Its better to assign the function result to a variable within the first `for` expression (as the first for expression is only interpreted once).

```PHP
$array = [1, 2, 3];
$length = count($array);
for($i = 0; $i < $length; $i++)
for($i = 0, $length = count($array); $i < $length; $i++)
// Either way is fine. The function is not being invoked within the loop over and over again. 
```

This issue is presented for every type of loop.
