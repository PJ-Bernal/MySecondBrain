[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

When you open a page, the following events occur in sequence:

1. `DOMContentLoad`: event fires when the HTML document has been completely parsed, and all deferred scripts (`<script defer src="â€¦">` and `<script type="module">`) have downloaded and executed, and the DOM tree is built. It doesn't wait for other things like images, subframes, and async scripts to finish loading. ^b4c270

In this event, you can start selecting DOM nodes or initialize the interface.

```html
<body>
    <p id="message">This text will change after the DOM is fully loaded.</p>
    <img src="large-image.jpg" alt="A large image">
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // The DOM is fully loaded at this point
    document.getElementById('message').textContent = 'The DOM is fully loaded!';
});
```
>[!blank-container|float-left]

Detail the string `This text will change after the DOM is fully loaded` is never shown in the browser. 



2. `load`. the browser fully loaded the HTML and also external resources like images and stylesheets.

```html
<style>
        #loading {
            display: block;
            font-size: 24px;
            text-align: center;
            margin-top: 50px;
        }
        #gallery {
            display: none;
        }
</style>
<div id="loading">Loading gallery...</div>
    <div id="gallery">
        <img src="https://example.com/image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
        <img src="https://example.com/image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
        <img src="https://example.com/image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
</div>
<script>
        window.addEventListener('load', function() {
            // This code runs when everything has finished loading
            document.getElementById('loading').style.display = 'none';
            document.getElementById('gallery').style.display = 'block';
            console.log('All resources have finished loading!');
        });
</script>
```

If the `load` event is not manipulated (this means, if the whole script tag in the example is removed), then the gallery remains hidden:

When I leave a page, this events occur in sequence:

>[!multi-column]
>
>1. `beforeunload`. Fires before the page and resources are unloaded. You can use this event to show a confirmation dialog to confirm if you really want to leave the page. By doing this, you can prevent data loss in case you are filling out a form and accidentally click a link to navigate to another page.
>
>2. `unload`. fires when the page has completely unloaded. You can use this event to send the analytic data or to clean up resources.

All these four events can be handled the same way with:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',() => {
    // handle DOMContentLoaded event
});

document.addEventListener('load',() => {
    // handle load event
});

document.addEventListener('beforeunload',() => {
    // handle beforeunload event
});

document.addEventListener('unload',() => {
    // handle unload event
});

```
