# About the action method to test
This test will check if the result of an action in a controller is of a certain type.

This is the action method to test. The return type of the method is `Ok`, which is an `ObjectResult`. Another object results can be tested like `NotFound`, `BadRequest`, etc.

Also, the implementation is using manual mapping, not auto mapper, and is returning a dto. That's another two things I can test.

# Testing the object result return type
Detailing the controller class it has two dependencies. This gives a hint of what should I mock; the employee service and a mapper. 
## Creating the test
Create a class for this test.

To be able to test the controller action method, I need an instance of the controller, and according to its constructor, I need a employee service and an auto mapper. 

Arrange the test creating mock instances of the employee service and the mapper. Now, looking at the action method implementation, the only method that is called is the `FetchInternalEmployeesAsync`, so I have to set up that.

Then, mock the auto mapper dependency. The action is not using auto mapper, so when creating the controller instance, pass null, for now.

To act.

Then for assert use the Is Type.

## Test will fail
Up to this point the test will fail because the action method return itself an `ActionResult<T>`, in this case of IEnumerable of Internal Employee dto. Remember returning an action result of T is  good practice for controllers.

Now, the method returns an action result, but I need the result of that result. So first, I want to assert what I get back is an action result of an i enmuerable of internal employee dto. This holds in a variable.

And then, that variable has a result property that is the actual action result, the object result.
