[[12.12 React|React]]

Keys are use mainly when rendering list to help react determine what's new and should be re-mount and what's constant and should be re-render. 

If any of the items in a list were to change, React don't have a clear way to know which one will be updated. So it has two solutions: 
1. Re-render the entire list.
2. Hunt the specific item and re-render that.

Keys tell React which array item each component corresponds to; also they track which element was changed. When a list is updated for whatever reason, React matches the `keys` of each the previous list items to the updated list. Then React can can detect a change and will only update the items that have changed.

Keys are only needed during re-renders and for neighboring elements of the same type. 

## Keys rules
1. Must be unique among siblings. However, it’s okay to use the same keys for JSX nodes in different arrays.
2. Keys must not change or that defeats their purpose! Don’t generate them while rendering.
3. Must be string or number.
