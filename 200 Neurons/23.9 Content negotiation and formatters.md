# Content negotiation
Process of selecting the best representation for a given request when there are multiple representations available.  

Content negotiation is made by the `Accept: <media type>`, and the `Conent-type` headers of the request. If the user wants `application/json`, the server should return that. 

In REST the `Accept` header must always be included; but if not, returning a default format is acceptable. 
## When no header is available or the format is not supported by the API
If this is the case, use a default format, typically JSON.

But is better to avoid this if the format is not supported because the consumer is expecting a specific format to be parsed. This is the case for a 406 status code. 

# Formatters
ASP.NET Core supports output and input formatters.

DETAIL, the formatters stablish the out and input format FOR A REQUEST message. Meaning the request could have both, but generally, the Accept header is a must. 

The content type header tells the API it will have to parse the body to, to be able to process the message.

The response message can contain the content type header to identify the media type of the response body.
