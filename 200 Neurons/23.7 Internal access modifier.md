[[13.7 C Sharp|C#]]

Though some classes can have a signature like [[23.7 Class template and members#Class template|this]], the public access modifier can change to `internal`
in fact, this access modifier is the default modifier when creating a class using a template. 

This keyword makes classes only available within the assembly [question:: wtf does this mean]. So to test a class, I need to make it public.
