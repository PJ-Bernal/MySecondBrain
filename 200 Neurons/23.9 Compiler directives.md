# About the compiler directives
When multiple service classes use the same implementation (meaning their methods have the same name but different implementation) use a compiler directive to choose either or. 

Compiler directives are directives (keywords followed by a `#`) that tell the compiler to include or omit pieces of code on compile using symbols (plain regular words followed after the directives) 

# Conditional compilation
Use `#if`, `#elif`, `#else`, and `#endif`. The `DEBUG` symbol is created automatically, so it can be used directly in the code. 

When the build is debug, the highlighted code is local mail service. Any other build, like release, will use the cloud mail service.
