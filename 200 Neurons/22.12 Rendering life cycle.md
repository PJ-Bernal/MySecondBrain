[[12.12 React|React]]

Remember a component is render only when its called, no matter if its being called at the beginning of a parent's implementation. 
## Initial component call
- Creates a place in memory for that component's state.
- Initializes all state values (useState hooks)
- Creates any references (useRef hooks)

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);     // State initialization
  const ref = useRef(null);                  // Ref initialization
```

## First render phase
- Runs through all the code in the component body.
- Evaluates expressions and conditionals.
- Builds a virtual representation of the UI (Virtual DOM).

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  // All this code runs during render phase
  const doubled = count * 2;
  if (count > 5) {
    return <div>Too high!</div>;
  }
  return <div>{doubled}</div>;
}
```

## Commit phase
- React takes the virtual DOM representation.
- Compares it with the actual DOM.
- Makes the minimum necessary changes to update the real DOM.
- Actually shows the changes on screen

## Effects stage
- React runs all useEffect hooks in order.

## Re-render triggers
- Its state changes (setState is called).
- Its props change.
- Its parent component re-renders.
- Its context values change
