# Using an interface
## Functions using interfaces
After creating the interface, use it as any other type annotation type. In this example, the function return value must implement the `Movie` type, if the tittle is not present, that's a mistake. 

This is an example of a function using an interface.

Method signatures benefit from interfaces as they make parameters more readable. (In this example, cast is not part of the function signature).

In this case, the parameter `movie` is using the interface `Movie`, therefore, inside of the method implementation I need to use dot notation to access the `movie` properties.

## Duck typing in action
`myMovie` is not using the interface, but it has the same shape defining on the interface, therefore, the method can use the object with no problem. It doesn't matter if it has additional properties.

## Constrain an object with an interface
Not having all the properties, or have more, breaks the interface.

This object breaks the below interface, the interface doesn't have the genre and previously viewed properties.

# Interface with optional properties
If the interface has an optional property, the object is not require to implement it to be treat as a Movie.
