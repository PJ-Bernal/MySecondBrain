First, the action method will use the auto mapper instead of a manual map method.

# Creating the test
The og code the test class. Detail the instance of the controller class is passing null when using the auto mapper.

So, first, create a mock on IMapper, because that's what the controller constructor is expecting.

However, for unit tests the actual auto mapper is used instead of a mock, so I don't need to mock the auto mapper. So create a mapper configuration object, passing the profile used for the test, in this example, `MapperProfiles.EmployeeProfile()`.

>in reality, I can use the actual mapper or mock the mapper only if needed.
