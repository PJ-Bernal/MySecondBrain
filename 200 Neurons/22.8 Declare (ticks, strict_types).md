>Declare is used to set the execution directive for a block of code. How the statement is executed and what side effects occur during execution may depend on the directive set in the directive block. The general syntax is: 
>
>```PHP
declare (directive)
statement

The directives dictates the behavior of the declare block. Currently only three directives are recognized: ticks, encoding and strict_types.

>[!important]
Directives are handled as the file is being compiled, **only literals** may be given as directive values 
>```PHP
>// This is valid:
>declare(ticks=1);
>
>// This is invalid:
>const TICK_VALUE = 1;
>declare(ticks=TICK_VALUE);
>```
## Ticks
### Ticks
A  tick is an event that occurs for every N low-level tickable statements executed by the parser within the declare block. Not all statements are tickable (like condition expressions and argument expressions). Having these tickets is useful because each tick can have an associate executable function.

Now, the `register_tick_function()` is used to tell the parser which function execution when the specified amount of ticks is fulfilled. And the `declare()` sets the amount of tickets to fulfill before that register function runs

>[!example]
>```PHP
>declare(ticks=1);
>// A function called on each tick event
>function tick_handler()
>{
>    echo "tick_handler() called\n";
>}
>register_tick_function('tick_handler'); // causes a tick event
>$a = 1; // causes a tick event
>if ($a > 0) {
>    $a += 2; // causes a tick event
>    print $a; // causes a tick event
>}
>/*tick_handler() called
>tick_handler() called
>tick_handler() called
>3tick_handler() called
>*/
>```

>[!example]
>
>```PHP
>function onTick(){
>    echo 'tick<br />';
>}
>register_tick_function('onTick');
>declare(ticks = 3);
>$i = 0;
>$lenght = 10;
>while ($i < $lenght){
>    echo $i++ . '<br />';
>}
>/*
>Tick
>0
>1
>2
>Tick
>3
>4… 
>*/
>```


## Strict_type
Useful to prevent any kind of casting. Use this syntax `declare(strict_types = 1)`, and must be the first line in the script. 

>[!important]
>When using a script file that has a strict type on it, on another file, that other file must have its own strict type declaration.

In this image, the index file has its own declare statement, but check the current file don’t. Therefore, when using ‘5’ PHP make the coercing and no error is made when it should be because I’m using a function whose script HAS a strict_type.
