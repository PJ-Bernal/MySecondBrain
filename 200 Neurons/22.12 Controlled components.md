[[12.12 React|React]]

Some HTML, like input elements have their own internal state which React can't directly manipulate. To allow React to do this, the 'free' internal state must be wrapped with the state hook. Then, it can be manipulated. 

In this example the element is not maintaining its own state as `value` is chaining to uppercase. 

```jsx
function CustomInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");
  
  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setValue(event.target.value.toUpperCase());
  };

  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={value}
      onChange={handleChange}
    />
  );
}
```
