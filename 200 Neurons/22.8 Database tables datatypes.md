## Data types
Tables are written in SQL, thus, each column have their own data type. 
### Int
Or `BIGINT`, use `( )` to specified how many numbers the query will show inside the table. `INT (5) 987654321` will be shown as `54321`. By default write `INT (11)`. Int can store numbers from -2147483647 to 2147483647, which is 4 bytes. 
#### SQL signed and unsiged
To tell SQL if I want to store the sign of a integer. For example `INT (11) UNSIGNED` can store numbers from 0 to 4294967295, because I still have the same 4 bytes available. 
### float and double
Double for larger decimal numbers. 
### Varchar
`( )` default value is 1, so always specify a number, because in varchar case, the number is the amount of characters the column can store (useful for user names, passwords, etc.). If more characters are written, the last characters will be cut of like this: `VARCHAR (5)` and the store data is `My name is Pablo`, the table will only store `My na`. 
### Text
To store a big amount of characters, like a blog post. 
### Date
To create dates like `2024-03-25`. Format is important because data can get store incorrectly within the database. 
### Datetime
It includes the date and also the time `2024-03-25 11:30:51`
