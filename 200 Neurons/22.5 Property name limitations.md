[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

## Property name limitations
Object's property names have no restrictions, meaning they can use reserved words like for, let, return, symbols, etc. 

```javascript
// these properties are all right
let obj = {
  for: 1,
  let: 2,
  return: 3
};

alert( obj.for + obj.let + obj.return );  // 6
```

### Number 0 becomes a string "0"
Other name are automatically converted to strings. Detail both calls are coerced to string, and the key is also coerced to string. 

```javascript
let obj = {
  0: "test" // same as "0": "test"
};

// both alerts access the same property (the number 0 is converted to string "0")
alert( obj["0"] ); // test
alert( obj[0] ); // test (same property)
```
### Can't use __proto__
I cant use proto as a key name. Detail the property assignation to 5 is ignored. 

```javascript
let obj = {};
obj.__proto__ = 5; // assign a number
alert(obj.__proto__); // [object Object] - the value is an object, didn't work as intended
```
