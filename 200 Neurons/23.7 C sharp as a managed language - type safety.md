[[13.7 C Sharp|C#]]
# Runtime and type safety
C# could be considered as a managed language, being strongly typed, and **all** type information is available while coding, at runtime allowing more safety checks and convenience of memory management via garbage collector. 

In C#, the runtime maintains detailed information about types, their properties, methods, inheritance, etc. This information is available while the programs runs! Allowing to inspect and work with types programmatically.

In comparison with JS, the language doesn't maintain detail information about the structure of the data types.

```js
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

const person = new Person("John", 30);

// In JavaScript, we can access properties:
console.log(person.name);  // "John"

// But we can't easily get detailed information about the Person type itself
// typeof just tells us it's an "object"
console.log(typeof person);  // "object"
```

```c#
public class Person 
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

var person = new Person { Name = "John", Age = 30 };

// We can access properties like in JavaScript:
Console.WriteLine(person.Name);  // "John"

// But we can also examine the type itself:
Type personType = person.GetType();
Console.WriteLine(personType.Name);  // "Person"
Console.WriteLine(personType.Assembly);  // Shows which assembly contains this type
Console.WriteLine(personType.IsClass);  // True
foreach (var property in personType.GetProperties())
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Property: {property.Name}, Type: {property.PropertyType}");
}
```

This enables the use of dependency injection that can automatically create and connect objects, understand class structure and map it to databases via object-relational mappers (ORMs), and serialization libraries.
