[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

Generally, JS code runs when a `script` tag is encounter. Including JavaScript at the top of the HTML, many of these DOM manipulation methods will not work because the JS code is being run before the nodes are created in the DOM. One way to solve is to include the script tag at the end of the HTML, so the code runs after the DOM nodes are parsed and created.

A better solution involves embedding the JS file in the `<head>` of your HTML (some libraries require that) using the `<script>` tag with the src attribute containing the path to the JS file, and the `defer` attribute. 

```HTML
<head>
  <script src="js-file.js" defer></script>
</head>
```

## The defer attribute
The defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the DOM is fully built, but **before** the [[22.5 Page load events - DOMContentLoad  - Load - beforeUnload - Unload#^b4c270|DOMContentLoaded]] event. 

```html
<p>...content before scripts...</p>

<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => alert("DOM ready after defer!"));
</script>

<script defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1"></script>

<p>...content after scripts...</p>
```

In this example: 
1. Both p tags are show immediately.
2. Log script loaded appears.
3. The DOM event is fired after the defer script, showing: DOM ready after defer!
