[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

The purpose of async code in C# is freeing up threads so they can be used for other tasks, for scalability, not performance, improvements. Freeing a thread happens for I/O operations, just like I/O from a db. 

The server resources translates into threads.

Imagine a sync I/O db request comes into the API, then ASP.NET Core requires a thread from the thread pool, which will be blocked until the I/O call is finished, therefore, is not available to handle other request. That thread must finish that request before doing something else. 

If there are no thread available, a third new request must wait because.

As soon as the thread finish with their request, it will be available and finally it can be used by another request. 

Detail also meanwhile the I/O operation finishes, those two threads are waiting doing nothing. 

# Async request
When the async request comes in, ASP.NET Core request a thread from the thread pool. Once the request action is started, like calling to the db, the thread return to the thread pool. Only when the I/O (or the request action) finish, the thread is require to handle the rest of the request. 

In this image, one thread has been used for a second request while the first request is still going on.

Once the request ends, the I/O call ends, the thread will be called to handle the response. In the image, the thread is used again when the operation ends

Therefore a single request can be handled by different threads, and one thread can handle different request.
