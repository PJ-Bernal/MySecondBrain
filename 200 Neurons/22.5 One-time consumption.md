[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

Requests and responses body are implemented as streams ( data source that can be read or written to in chunks, rather than all at once). In this context are design to be used once (one-time requesting or one-time responding), once used is considered consumed and can' be used again. 

```js
const request = new Request("https://example.org/post", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ username: "example" }),
});

const response1 = await fetch(request); // Here the request has been consumed
console.log(response1.status);

// Will throw: "Body has already been consumed."
const response2 = await fetch(request);
console.log(response2.status);
```

To solve this I can clone the request or make a new one.

```js
const request = new Request("https://example.org/post", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ username: "example" }),
});

const response1 = await fetch(request.clone());
console.log(response1.status);

const response2 = await fetch(request);
console.log(response2.status);
```
