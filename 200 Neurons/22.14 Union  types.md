# Casting for union types
When working with union types, if a type is a specific subset, like in this case, is better to use casting so TS detect the type better.

Detail TS is telling me the type is 5, when in reality should be `1|2|3|4|5|6|8|`.

# Union type control flow
When a function branches, the control flow usually tend to type the function as a union type.

## Example
In this example, `outcome2` is the type of either success of fail, therefore, because is a union type, I can't access the property email, because is not in both types.

This is an example that with union types, TS will get me what is common in both types, for example, I didn't know the Error type have a property called name, but is there. 

To use a specific property of a given type in an union type I need a type guard, or a discriminated union. 

# Everything is about the shape
This example shows that everything is about the shape.

When creating a variable, check if the type represented by the left hand side, is a subset of the right hand side. When working with functions is the same story, but be careful when using type assertion.

The first three function don't work because each one of their parameters is expecting to work with an Even ONLY, then `OneThroughFive` ONLY, then only the number 2 or 4 ONLY, but x is `Evens` AND `OneThroughFive`. In this example x is being type asserted, so even its value is 6, is not working.

Detail what happens when working with type checking.

# Type guards
`instanceOf` is a type guard that tells TS to narrow the type of second based on a condition. 

Up to this moment, second can be either `{ name: "Mike North"; email: "mike@example.com" }` (from the success tuple) or `Error`, and I want to do something depending if second is an error or the object.

Inside of the if block, TS knows that second must be an Error type because the condition `second instanceof Error` is true, inside of else TypeScript knows that second cannot be an Error, so it must be the other possible type: `{ name: "Mike North"; email: "mike@example.com" }`.

Detail, thanks to the type guard, the code knows second, in the first branch, is the type Error and now I can access the Error properties. The same goes for the else branch, now I can use the object properties. 

Type guards allows to grab union type and 'make it a pie chart' if this part of the pie is this type, then do this, if its not of that type, well it must be the other type.

If I have more union types, I should have more `instanceOf` type guards, for each case, and the else is what is left on the pie. 
# Discriminated union
A discriminated union is a TS pattern where union types shares a common property called discriminant, with a unique value in each type, that can be use to distinguish between the types. 

The common property type in this example is the string type of the variable `first`,When you check `first === "error"`. If `first` is `"error"`, then `second` must be an `Error`.

In a discriminated union, the discriminate is used to indicate the control flow what is the whole tuple in the case the condition is met, that's why if fist is an error, well, the whole tuple must the type Error.

>The discriminant must be a literal type or the union of literal types; think that as a label.
