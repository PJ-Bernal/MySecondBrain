>[!quote]- What is scope MDN
>The **scope** is the current context of execution in which [values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Value) and expressions are "visible" or can be referenced. If a [variable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Variable) or expression is not in the current scope, it will not be available for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.

>[!example|float-right-small]-
>```js
>function greeting() {
  const userName = "Sarah";
  console.log(\`Hello ${userName}!\`);
}
greeting(); // "Hello Sarah!"
console.log(userName); // ReferenceError: userName is not defined

The scope is defined in a current execution context in which a variable or function is accessible or not, dictating its lifetime and visibility. There are several kinds and they can be nested. 

Visit [[22.5 Variable hoisting - declaration vs initialization - hoisting functions - hoisting classes - nested functions]] to remember the scope of every declaration type.

Scope importance:
1. Ownership: variables can be accessible in their own scope, not everywhere within the code. This makes variables security and accessible inly in certain parts of the program. 
2. Avoid name collision: this allows to use of the same name in different scopes.
3. garbage collection: no scope means the compiler will not be able to identify when to collect the garbage, except at the end.
4. `{ }` don't create scopes for `var`, but create a scope for `let` and `const`. 

>Inner functions have access to variables of outer scopes.
```js
function init() {
  var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, that forms a closure
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
init();
```
## Global scope
A variable have a global scope when its declared outside of a block `{ }` or outside a function or block, meaning is available everywhere in the code (inside functions, conditionals, blocks, loops, etc.). Global variables are visible from any function (unless shadowed by locals), check [[22.5 Function's variable scope#Same-named variable declaration|this example]]. 

![[22.5 var - variable and function hoisting with var -  var within the window object#^7ff085]]

### Best practices
- Avoid using global variables, unless they were constants or needed because their value could change several times during program execution. What will happen if multiple parts of the code modify the same variable? Tracking this could be difficult. 
- Global values make the code less modular, and this could make maintenance a bit difficult. 
- Use descriptive names for global variables. 

## Function/local scope
Each function creates its own scope, this kind of scope is almost the same as the local scope. This means a variable created within a function can't be accessed outside the function. 
>[!example|float-right]
>```js
// Initialize a global variable
var species = "human"; 
function transform() {
  // Initialize a local, function-scoped variable
  var species = "werewolf";
  var b = 10; 
  console.log(species);
}
// Log the global and local variable
>console.log(b); //Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined
console.log(species); //human
transform(); //werewolf
console.log(species);//human

Variables or functions _declared_ within a function or method (local scope are declare within blocks only), that are only accessible within its own block. 

Local scope protects variables from being modified by code outside their own scope. 

Local scope allows to use of a variable with the same name without changing or reassigning the value, hiding the variable of the higher scope and preventing modifications. This is called [[22.5 Variable shadowing - shadowing broke scope chain|variable shadowing]]. 

>Even calling a function won't make the local variable accessible outside its scope. 

```js
// program showing block-scoped concept
// global variable
let a = 'Hello';

function greet() {
    // local variable
    let b = 'World';
    console.log(a + ' ' + b); //Hello World

    if (b == 'World') {
        // block-scoped variable
        let c = 'hello';
        console.log(a + ' ' + b + ' ' + c); //Hello World Hello
    }
    // variable c cannot be accessed here
    console.log(a + ' ' + b + ' ' + c); //Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined
}
greet();
```

### Best practices
- Isolation: prevents interference with other variables in the code. 
- Modularity: allows compartmentalization of the code, making it easy to maintain. 
- Reusability of variables (for example, cont in several blocks).
## Block scope
Variables are accessible only within curly braces declaration with if, else, switch, for and while; don't interact with any global or function variables. (remember var is the only function scoped!). 

Here is an example of local vs block scope.
>[!example]- block vs local scope
>```js
>function myFunction() {
>  if (true) {
>    var localVariable = "I'm in block scope";
>    let blockVariable = "I'm also in block scope";
>  }
>  console.log(localVariable); // Accessible
>  console.log(blockVariable); // Error: blockVariable is not defined
>}
>// Another example of block scope
>{
  let y = 10;
}
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined

>[!example]- Remember let and const are block scope, not function or global scoped
>```javascript
>function exampleBlockScope() {
>  if (true) {
>    let blockVariable = "I'm block-scoped with 'let'";
>    const constantBlockVar = "I'm block-scoped with 'const'";
>  }
>  console.log(blockVariable); // Error: blockVariable is not defined
>  console.log(constantBlockVar); // Error: constantBlockVar is not defined
>}

In some cases I need a variable whose value is undefine at the beginning, so I can declare the variable, make it function scope, and inside the block, assign its value.

```js
function isCool(name) {
  let cool;
  if(name === 'wes') {
    cool = true;
  }
  console.log(cool);
  return cool;
}
```
## Scope chain
The scope chain is how JS engine searches for variables visibility and accessibility in the current scope using 'stacked layers' representing each one a scope (global scope at the bottom, and the local/block scope at the top) for variable accessibility until is found or not.  The scope chaining process always begins at the current scope moving up between layers (from block to local, to function scope, for example. Never going moving down); this is why outer functions can't access inner functions variables. 

>[!example]-
>Thanks to the scope chain, the innerFunction can access variables from their local, outer and global scope.
>```javascript
>var globalVariable = "I'm global";
>function outerFunction() {
>  var outerVariable = "I'm in outer scope";
>  function innerFunction() {
>    var innerVariable = "I'm in inner scope";
>    console.log(innerVariable); // Access innerVariable
>    console.log(outerVariable); // Access outerVariable
>    console.log(globalVariable); // Access globalVariable
>  }
>  innerFunction();
>}
>outerFunction(); 
>/// Im inner scope
>// Im outer scope
>// Im global

>[!example]-
>```javascript
var x = 10;
function outer() {
  var x = 20;
  function inner() {
>      var x = 30;
>    console.log(x); // Accesses x from the innermost scope (x = 30)
  }
  inner();
  console.log(x); // Accesses x from the outer scope (x = 20)
}
outer();
console.log(x); // Accesses x from the global scope (x = 10)

Thanks to the scope chain, variables and functions can be used by other variables or functions in another scope. Thanks to the lexical scope, the scope of a variable or function can be determined just by looking at the source code in which was created; leaving aside the need to analyze the 'code environment' at the invoked moment.

![[Pasted image 20231219144132 1.png]]


## Lexical scope
The scope chain follows a principle known as lexical (static or compile-time scope) scoping that tells the scope is determined by where the function is declared, not where it's called. 

Lexical scope use the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available for the rest of the code. 
>[!example|float-left-medium]
>```javascript
>const userName = "Peter";
>
>function sayUserName() {
>  console.log(userName); //The lexical scope of the function uses Peter as the value, so whenever is called, it'll always print Peter
>}
>sayUsername(); // Peter
>
>function sayUserNameAgain() {
>  const userName = "Sarah";
>  // Invoke the first function
>  sayUserName();
>}
>
>sayUserNameAgain(); // Peter

The sayUserName() function scope is global, thus it can be called at any moment. Also, the function scope uses the userName variable when the function is defined. 

So when the function is called in the second function, it doesn't matter if a variable, even with the same name, is created next to the function, again, because the scope is created where the function is declared and not where its called. 
>[!warning|float-right]
>```js
>function sum (){
>    function rest(){
>        let a = 10;>
>        console.log(a);
>    }
>}
>rest();
>// ReferenceError: rest is not defined
>```








This is because of the lexical scope, as the function's scope is defined in the first lines. 

The same behavior causes a function not to be called outside its scope. 

>[!info]- static scope vs dynamic scope
>Other languages use dynamic scope, that alter the behavior of the function depending where is called. 

## Nested scopes
Scopes can be nested (functions inside functions, block inside functions, etc.). Thanks to the scope chain, the inner scope has access to the outer scope variables and functions, but not vice versa. 

```JS
// Outer function
function calcAge(birthyear) {
    const userName = "Peter";
    const currentYear = 2021;
    const age = currentYear - birthyear;
 
    // Inner block
    if (age <= 60) {
      const message = `${userName} is still employed!`; //Peter is still employed
      console.log(message);
      function sum(){
        console.log("example of nested code: " + userName); //example of nested code: Peter
      }
      sum();
    }
  
    // Inner function
    function yearsToRetire() {
      const retirement = 60 - age;
      console.log(`${userName} will be retired in ${retirement} years!`); //Peter will be retired in 14 years
    }
    yearsToRetire();
  }
  calcAge(1975);
