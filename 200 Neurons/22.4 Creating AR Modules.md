[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]


`ApplicationRecords` acts as an abstract class that is created within the `appp/models/application_record.rb`. It **acts as a namespace** for `ActiveRecord::Base` inherit everything for it. SO I rather use the Records than Base when creating my modules. 

## How to create a module
This will create a `Product` model mapped to a `products` table at the db. 
```ruby
class Product < ApplicationRecord
end
```
