[[13.5 Bash|Bash]]

## Introducing the shell
The UNIX shell `bash` (the most popular) is both a Command-Line Interface (CLI) and a scripting language with automaticity and network machine manipulation capabilities.

In UNIX, the shell is a layer within the overall operating system architecture that have a large bearing in any workflow. This layering  provides flexibility in terms of choosing any shell and not a standard or defined one.  

Opened by the first time, the shell could look like this; where `$`, the prompt, indicates the starting of the command line that has to be run with the enter key. Most popular shell environments put my user name before the prompt by default.

## How to open the shell
To open the terminal use `ctrl + alt + t`. Usually, the default shell is `bash`, to confirm this type: `echo $SHELL`. If the message printed doesn't end with `bash`, the default shell is something else and the execution of `bash` command is required.

## General shell command syntax

Options (call switches or flags for options that don't take arguments) change the behavior of a command and arguments tell what to operate on (sometimes both are not required). 

## Single and double tap
With long names using the tab will autocomplete, however, when the names are similar, typing the first letter and double tap will list those files.

Use `echo $BASH_VERSION`.
