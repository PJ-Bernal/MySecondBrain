There are two ways to pass data to methods
# By value
Is the default way to pass data to methods. The method get a copy of the value, meaning, the value in the caller **don't** change. 

In this example, both integers remain the same, there is no way to change its value.

# By reference
Require the use of `ref` keyword. A reference to the original value is used by the method, no copy is made. 

Before the method is invoked, all ref references must be initialized.

In this example, once the method is called, b change to 55.

By default, a method can return a single value, however, `ref` allows to return multiple values.
