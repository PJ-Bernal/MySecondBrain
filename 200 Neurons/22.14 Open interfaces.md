# About open interfaces
Interfaces are open, meaning, I can re-declare interfaces to add properties/methods.

When re-declaring an interface, all of its declarations are gather together across every single file that interface is used, and not only in the file where I re-declare the interface.
# Augmenting existing types
This is useful because I can add declarations to a given interface. 

This can't be done with type aliases.
