There are multiple ways to work with configuration files in C#, json, xml, etc. The most common is through `appsettings.json`.

This example will include the to and from, the mail services need in order to work. 

Because of the create builder method, C# know it has to read the app settings file. 

There's no need to restart the webserver to when the configuration file change. 

# Access settings
Through `IConfiguration` object in the class that need the configuration values using a constructor injection, first create the backing fields, and then use the `IConfiguration` interface as a constructor parameter and assign each field to the respective property. 

JSON has a child parent relation, so, start from the parent and use `:` to move through the kids.
