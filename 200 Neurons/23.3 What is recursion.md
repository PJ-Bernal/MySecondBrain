## When to use recursion
Recursion is not always the answer to solve big problems. Generally, a recursive solution can also be implemented iteratively (using while, for, for each, etc.), and in some cases, that could be the best way.
## What is recursion
Recursion is a function that calls itself using its identifier (within its implementation), aiming to solve something that requires a task to be repetitive over and over. Thus, this task can be divided into smaller and smaller parts of the same kind, until a specific and known condition is met to step this repetition. 
## Recursion parts
- Recursion base: condition or value either specific or a expression, that has to be met in order to stop the execution of the function call itself. When the base is reach, the whole recursive calls return a value and everything ends [[23.3 The execution contexts and the stack with recursion|this example]]. This is also the simplest scenario of a recursive step, in [[23.3 What is recursion#How to approach to a recursive solution|this example]], the base case is the factorial of 1, so I want to stop everything when the nesting function get to 1. 
- Recursion depth: argument/parameter of the function that tells maximal number of nested calls. 
- Recursive step: expression that includes calling the function itself **making itself** shorter or simpler. The key here is to think the function is being called, meaning, its arguments must be altered in order to make it comply with the recursion base. 

In this example, the recursive function is being part of an expression and the arguments are being altered, thus, the recursion base can be met when n = 1.

## Iterative vs recursion solution
This example show the same pow function written iteratively and recursively.

```js
function pow(x, n) {
  let result = 1;

  // multiply result by x n times in the loop
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result *= x;
  }

  return result;
}

alert( pow(2, 3) ); // 8
```

### How to use recursion
1. There must be something to do over an over again in smaller and smaller chunks; this indicates I might implement a recursive solution. In this case, multiplying a number by itself. 
2. I must know the recursion base, that is the condition/value to met in order to stop the 'over and over'. In this case, when the exponent is zero, the whole recursive must stop.
3. Create a recursive step that will transform the task into a simpler action.

## Recursive solution are usually shorter
Than iterative solutions.

```js
function pow(x, n) {
  return (n == 1) ? x : (x * pow(x, n - 1));
}
```

## How to approach to a recursive solution
One approach is to think in pseudo-code and write different function outcomes to detect what is constant, recursive.
