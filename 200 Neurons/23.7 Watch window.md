[[13.7 C Sharp|C#]]

Add a watch 'break point' to a variable, to see only the value of a variable over time. Right click, add watch. So, as soon the variable is in scope of the breakpoint, watch will show its current value.

This is useful when I want to check how the value of a variable change, for example, during a method call that has a loop. 

This is the state of the variable prior to step over the loop.

This is almost the same information as autos window, but here I can select which variables I want to check.
