[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

>[!quote]
>Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, or "Matz", in Japan in the mid 1990's. It was designed for programmer productivity with the idea that programming should be fun for programmers. It emphasizes the necessity for software to be understood by humans first and computers second.

Ruby offers by default a level of abstraction, that allows programmers to create higher level languages called Domain Specific Languages or DSL's like Rails and Rspec. 

>Because of this abstraction is often confusing to read Rails code without understanding Ruby, because Rails being a DSL, operates at a higher level of abstraction. Is like ""another programming language"". 

>[!important] Ruby is OO
>- Ruby is a strongly object-oriented language, which means that absolutely everything in Ruby is an object, even the most basic data types.
>	- It's not even strictly true; not everything in Ruby is an object. However, anything that can be said to have a value is an object: that includes numbers, strings, arrays, and even classes and modules. However, there are a few things that are not objects: methods, blocks, and variables are three that stand out.
