Mocking interfaces is more common that mocking classes, because generally the test dependencies are typically interfaces and not the direct implementations. 

This is an old test, without any interface mocks, that is using a repo with some test data.

Start with mocking the repo into a mock interface, the interface is already created in the code base.

And then pass the mock object to the employee service.

So, up to this point, the service is using only mocks. But as the last note, the `FetchInternalEmployee` is a method that, at this moment, is not present in the interface. So I need to set that up.

>After setting the return type, when invoking the method, think what my set up allows the parameter to be. In this case it accepts **any** guid, meaning, when invoking I can pass nothing, because at the end, the return type will be the same.

>What is cool about this type of mocking is that I don't need to create a whole repo implementation just for the test.
