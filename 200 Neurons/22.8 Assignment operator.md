[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

## Assignment operator
Multiple variable assignation work `$x = $y = 10;` and complex assignments `$x = ($y = 10) + 5;` but this is not readable. PHP uses the classic shorthand's `+=, -=, *=, /=, **=`. 

If a variable hasn't been assigned, the shorthand can be used and it will return something but this will trigger an error in the application.

>Assignment by default is done by value and not by reference. If I want to be by reference I must use `&`, check [[22.8 Variables#Assigned by value vs assigned by reference|this]].
