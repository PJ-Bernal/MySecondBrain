[[13.1 OO Programming|OOP]]

Abstraction in OOP can be based on [[22.4 Abstraction and operating systems|this definition]], taking into account the idea of something is completely separate for any **specific** instance (human, not my wife, a tall person, etc.). 

The focus on OOP abstraction is asking "What this class should look like for this application at this time". For one application, the gender, name and height attributes can be important; for another application the name and birthday also could be important. 

Means take something common and make it simpler to use, creating a simple interface for the object. Abstraction allows to provide a simple interface every object can rely on with methods or any other field useful for the object, regardless if the object implementation is hard, the abstraction, the interface must be easy to use exposing only what's required, and the implementation is hidden. 

The user of the class doesn't need to know how the implementation works, its abstracted away. Therefore, if the implementation changes, the interface should remain the same, improving maintainability of the code.
