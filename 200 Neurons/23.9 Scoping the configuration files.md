Configuration files are environment scoped, so each environment will have its own configuration file. The order of configuration files is important.

>[!important]
>Configurations are cumulative and can be override, therefore, configurations present in the `appsettings.json` will be valid in the development, production, and other files, unless their values are override.
# Create environment configuration files
Right click in project -> add new item -> search sett -> select app settings file and name it, for example, `appsettings.production.json`.

>[!important]
>Be mindful `appsettings.json` is a file (though it looks like a folder), and its 'the base' configuration file.
