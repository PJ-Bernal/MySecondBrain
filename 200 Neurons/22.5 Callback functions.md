Check [[22.5 High-end functions - declaration and invocation|this note]] for more context. 
## What is a callback function 
In general, a callback is a function (arrow, anonymous, any kind of function) that is passed as an **argument** to another function or method (when is invoked).  
### Sync callbacks
They executes normally with the flow of the program, for example inside of `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`. Errors in synchronous callbacks can be caught with a try-catch block in the calling code.

```js
[1, 2, 3].forEach(function(num) {
  console.log(num);
});

console.log("End");
```

```javascript
function ask(question, yes, no) {
  // Body use callbacks as function calls
  if (confirm(question)) yes()
  else no();
}

// Callback function
function showOk() {
  alert( "You agreed." );
}

// Callback function
function showCancel() {
  alert( "You canceled the execution." );
}

//high-end function invocation, callbacks passed as function references
ask("Do you agree?", showOk, showCancel);
```

}

  "Do you agree?",
  function() { alert("You agreed."); },
  function() { alert("You canceled the execution."); }
);

### Async callbacks
They executes **after** the high-end function has completed its operation.

>[!example]
>Error that happens when a callback is passed as a function call.
>```javascript
>function sayBoo() {
  console.log('Boo!')
}
>
// do this - reference the function by its name:
setTimeout(sayBoo, 3000)
// => Boo! is logged after three seconds.
>
// don't do this - invoke the function in place:
setTimeout(sayBoo(), 3000)
// => Boo! is logged instantly... nothing happens 3 seconds later.
>```

This is a pseudo-code of an async callback function.

```js
function addOne(thenRunThisFunction) {
  waitAMinuteAsync(function waitedAMinute() {
    thenRunThisFunction()
  })
}

addOne(function thisGetsRunAfterAddOneFinishes() {})
```

>a(function() {
>  b(function() {
>    c()
>  })
>})
>```


As a rule of thumb, if you have code that has to wait for some other async code to finish then you express that dependency by putting your code in functions that get passed around as callbacks.



I can have separate functions for be embed as callbacks, or embed the function directly in the callback call.

```js
var fs = require('fs')

function finishedReading(error, movieData) {
  if (error) return console.error(error)
  // do something with the movieData
}

fs.readFile('movie.mp4', finishedReading)

// Or embed directly
var fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile('movie.mp4', function finishedReading(error, movieData) {
  if (error) return console.error(error)
  // do something with the movieData
})
```

## How callback works
When a high-order function is executed, it'll take some time to finish, so instead of waiting for this process, JS continues to executing the next lines of code, and the callback is called once the async function is complete. 

In this example, when the `doSomethingAsync` function is called, it'll execute its implementation starting from the `setTimeout` function, taking 1000ms, the output `Task done!`, and then `Callback executed`. 

```js
function doSomethingAsync(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Task done!");
    callback();
  }, 1000);
}

doSomethingAsync(() => {
  console.log("Callback executed");
});

// Task done
// Callback executed
```

Another example.

```js
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = { id: 1, name: "John Doe" };
    callback(data);
  }, 1500);
}

fetchData((result) => {
  console.log("Data received:", result);
});
```

### Under the hood
Because the high-end function is calling the callback as a reference, the way callbacks behave is literally by embedding their **function body** inside of the high-end function. So the above function is the same as this:

```js
function fetchData() {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = { id: 1, name: "John Doe" };
    console.log("Data received:", data);
  }, 1500);
}

fetchData();
```

## Why callbacks are use for
Callbacks are primarily used to handle [[22.5 What are asynchronous and synchronous functions|async operations]] and also for function de-cluttering; imagine the above example with a complex function, the syntaxis will be awful and I won't know which one is the high-end function and the callback.  

The key to understanding callbacks is to realize that they are used when you don't know when some async operation will complete, but you do know where the operation will complete â€” the last line of the async function! 

In general, the high-end function can prepare data for the callback to execute it. Meaning they are extremely useful for I/O operations. 

Common use cases:
- Event listeners (e.g. `element.addEventListener('click', handleClick)`)
- Array methods (e.g., `array.forEach(console.log)`)
- Asynchronous functions (e.g., `fetchData(handleResponse)`)
- Timers (e.g., `setTimeout(updateUI, 1000)`)
