[[12.6 Git and Github|Git and GitHub]]

## What is Git?
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a very popular version control system ('program'). [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a service that allows you to upload, host, and manage your code using Git with a nice web interface.

Git is a version control system (an epic save button). A save in Git is a recording of differences in files and folders (historical record on each save), allowing one to review how projects grow, and to look at or restore file states from the past. 

Once connected to a network, Git allows you to push a project to GitHub or other group alternatives (Bitbucket, Beanstalk, or GitLab).

While Git works on a local machine; GitHub is a remote storage facility on the web; this means by learning Git I'll showcase my portfolio on GitHub. 
## Performance
Committing, branching merging and comparing past versions are all optimized for performance. Git focuses on the file content itself (what was renamed, split and rearranged). The object format of Git's repository files [question::what is the object format in Git] uses a combination of delta encoding (storing content differences), and compression and explicitly stores directory content and version metadata objects. 
## Snapshots, not differences

>>With Git, every commit (or save the state of a project) takes a picture of what all the files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. If the files don't change, Git doesn't store the file again, just links to a previous identical file it already stored. So, Git thinks about data like a stream of snapshots.

This is a major distinction from almost every other VCSs, this mini filesystem provides powerful tools built on top and explores the benefits of Git branching. 

## Nearly every operation is local
Most operations (like browsing the history of a project, reviewing changes in the last month, etc. are local, no need to ask or pull something for a server) Git needs only local files and resources to operate (the entire history of the project is on my local disk, and most operations seem almost instantaneous), generally, no information is needed from another computer (contrary to using a CVCS where most operations have network latency, they're server dependent).

This 'server-less' state grants several offline working capabilities (committing to my local copy) until get online again (let's say I can connect to my client's VPN at home, I can still work!). 

## Git has data integrity
Everything is checksummed before it is stored, everything is referred to by that checksum. It's impossible to change something without Git knowing about it. This is a built-in functionality, that prevents lost information in transit or file corruption without Git being able to detect it.

>>The checksum mechanism is called SHA-1 bash, a 40-character string composed of hexadecimal characters (0-9 a-f) and calculated based on the content of a file or directory.

>>Git stores everything using this hash code, not the file's name. It could look like this: `

## Git generally only adds data
Nearly all the actions in Git add data to the Git database. It's hard for the system to do something undoable or to erase data in any way; once a snapshot has been commited, is very difficult to lose it. Therefore, experiments can be made easily. 


## Git workflow
1. Files are modified in the working three.
2. You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds _only_ those changes to the staging area.
3. I commit, which takes files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently in the Git repository.
