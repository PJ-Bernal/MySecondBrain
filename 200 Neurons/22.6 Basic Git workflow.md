![[22.6 Git workflow.canvas|22.6 Git workflow]]
This is a webpage with a cheat sheet with the most basic GitHub commands. https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-git-basics

Whatever change was made ("all the project versions") to the project, is 'storage' within the .git folder (hidden by default) git provides.  

Git tracks a file only when it has been committed at least once. 

## VScode and Git
- Discard changes button: discard all the not staged changes of a tracked file/folder.

>And then I click the rever button, this is the output, the same file that I staged.

[question:: how do Git work with VScode]

## How to check differences with git diff
### Between the last commit and the last recent saved file
`git diff` compares the last commit of a file, to newer (and saved) versions of the file. Once the file is staged, the command stops giving output.

>[!warning]- the file has to be saved to use the command
>![[Pasted image 20240102111926 1.png|center|300]]
>In the image, the lines were deleted but the file is unsaved, thus, the command compares the last saved version, to the committed one and not to the current version of the file. 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240102111147 1.png|center|350]]
>The committed version of the file goes to the third line. Then, more code lines were added, and the command tracks those changes. Once the file is staged, the command doesn't show anything regardless of the file hasn't been committed yet. 
>![[Pasted image 20240102111356 1.png]]

### Between the last commit and the staged file
`git diff --staged` Detail in the example, the file has been saved already but line 7 of the code is not showing on the command output. The file has been staged only to line 5. 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240102112825 1.png|center|350]]

## How to check differences with git source control
Clicking on the source control and then on the file will compare the last commit to the staged file. Detail the second image is the current file saved status of the file.

## Update a commit with the newest code
I can simply commit again the file with the last changes, but if I really need to update the last commit, so the changes will be there, use `git reset --soft HEAD^*`. 

- The soft flag won't delete any changes from the file. 
- The `HEAD` is used to tell the command where branch I want to use this command. `HEAD` could be replaced with the hash of the previous commit I want to go back. 
- The `^*` refers to which commit after I want to apply the command. ^ is the last commit, ^2  is the second last and so on.

>[!example]- detail example
>![[Pasted image 20240102120849 1.png|center|350]]
>![[Pasted image 20240102121227 1.png|center|350]]

## Revert the status  / `git reset --mixed`
If I want to return the status of a project to a certain commit use `git reset --mixed 'hash-code`. This command will 'delete' the commits and unstage them but the changes committed will be there. 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240102132403 1.png|center|450]]
>Once the command is applied, the files are unstaged, **but the files keep** the changes of their last commit, in this case Robin and Linterna added.


## Revert the status in full / `git reset --hard`
`git reset --hard 'hash-code` will revert the status of the project, deleting all the changes, even the committed ones. 

If I use `HEAD^` I'm telling Git to reset one hashcode back from where the HEAD is at the moment. 

`git reset --hard` reset the repo to the last commit made. 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240102133122 1.png|center|350]]
>That file was committed once. Then, a mixed reset was made and that's why the changes still appear. The original wasn't committed with the last two lines of code. After the hard reset, those lines disappear. 
>![[Pasted image 20240102133324 1.png|center|350]]

>[!example]- Detail hard don't erase untracked folders, but delete files. 
>![[Pasted image 20240102133855 1.png|center|400]]
>Here the 'ciudades' file was deleted. 

## Review all git history actions
`git reflog` shows all the history of changes and actions made on the repo. 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240102134904 1.png]]
>Detail how the files and folders are constructed again. 

## Rename a file
With `git mv current-name new-name`, this has to be done within the same carpet, so is not an actual movement of the file. The file has to be tracked. 
>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240102140935 1.png|center|400]]
>Git detects the renamed file.

Another way to do this is renaming the file within VScode, however, Git will assume now the renamed file is a totally new file (untracked btw) and the old file was deleted. _Becuase of this, the above method is more recommeneded_. In this case, the file was only renamed and not edited in any way, by adding the renamed file to the staged area, Git compare both files and knows the file was not new, just renamed (that is why the 'R'). However, if the was deleted, the 'old' file that contains the original name gets deleted. 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240102142921 1.png|center|350]]
>Detail Git thinks there is one new file that is untracked ?? and the original file was deleted. However, once added, the file 'scan both files' and bc they are the same, now it knows it was just a rename. 

## Delete files `git rm`
`git rm 'filen_name_here` this is a change within the repo, so it has to be staged and committed. 

## Ignore files `.gitignore`
Some files don't require to be tracked. So, on the root folder of the project create `.gitignore` file whose content will be the folders or files that Git will ignore. This file must be tracked by Git.

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240102145106 1.png|center]]

## Stage area
### Staged several files
The wildcard will stage all files in the current directory. If no directory is specified, it'll staged files in the 'root' directory. 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20231228131928 1.png]]
>In this case, the root directory is '02 Bases'. 
>
>Now, if the files are in another directory I must specified which.
>![[Pasted image 20231228132046 1.png]]

If the file name is empty [[22.6 What is git#^26e68d|like in this case with the upload folder]] the wildcard must be delete so the command will be `git add uploads/.gitkeep`
### Staged all within a folder
To staged all within a folder and its sub-folders `git add folder_name/`


## Fallback to previous commit / Checkout
At a file-level, checkout command updates the working directory, not the staged area, also this won't move the HEAD, so I won't switch between branches. 

>[!example]
>- `git checkout -- .` updates all track files (a new file that wasn't committed is not going to be obtained back) of the project to the last commit. The `--` tells Git what comes next is a file name, not a branch name. 
>- `git checkout HEAD~2 file_to_check.js` updates the selected file to the second-last commit. 

>Useful to inspect old versions of the project 

[[question:: real differences between restore, reset, revert and checkout OMG]]
## How to un-staged a file 
### Restore
Restore command is used to remove files from the staging area or _to discard changes made to the working tree_, once they have been tracked (committed at least once) by Git. Also, it doesn't modify the commit history. 

![[Pasted image 20231228093315 1.png|center|500]]




>[!example]- Remove files/folders from the staging area
>>![[Pasted image 20231228092642 1.png]]
>>![[Pasted image 20231228092713 1.png]]
>>An untracked file is created, then staged and finally committed. Then the file is modified, and because of its tracked, the command can un-staged the file. 
>>

>[!example]- discard changes made on the working three
>>![[Pasted image 20231228093013 1.png]]
>>![[Pasted image 20231228093112 1.png]]
>>![[Pasted image 20231228093048 1.png]]
>>A tracked file has been edited with 'second change', because is tracked, Git knows its been modified, but the file is not staged. Detail how I use the `git restore test.txt` command to not un-staged, but discard completely the changes. 

### Reset
If the file is untracked by Git, I can use the reset command. `git reset file_name.txt`

## How to remove or un-do commits
Every commit has its own hash-code, and each one is built on the top of a previous commit. So I can't delete commits, but revert the state the project using the  hash-code of the commit I want to go back.

>>Imagine the last two commits were made something by mistake. Because of the built-in top commit behavior I can't delete the middle commit, so I have to go back to the first commit. 
>>1. Copy the hash-code of the commit I want to go back. 
>>2. Use `git reset hash-code`
