## What is version control?
Version Control is a system that records all changes to a file or set of files (whatever kind of file, not only source code) over time to recall specific versions, revert files or entire projects to a previous state, and compare changes over time (who made modifications, introduced an issue, etc.). 

>[!info]- Code changes dynamically
>Version control protects the source code from human error. Code is almost always written in teams (one writes new code, the other solves a bug), which means the code changes dynamically in several parts. Changes made in one part of the software can be incompatible with those made by another developer working at the same time. This problem should be discovered and solved in an orderly manner without blocking the work of the rest of the team.

>[!info]- What makes a VCS good?
>- Supports a developer's preferred workflow without imposing one.
>- Works in any platform, OS agnostic. 
>- Facilitates a smooth and continuous flow of changes rather than using a clumsy mechanism.

>[!tip]- Why is it required?
>Not using a VCS prevents other team members from knowing the changes made in the code, creates incompatible changes, and creates manually controlled versions of the project. Some of the advantages of using a VCS are:
>- Complete long-term change history of every file. 
>- [[22.6 Branching and merging|Branching and merging]].
>- Traceability, to trace and connect each change to a project management and bug tracking software such as `Jira`, describing the purpose of the change. 

>VCS assigns a unique hash code, date, time and name to every modification done to the main.

### Local version control system
Is a simple database that keeps track of all the changes of the files within a local system (not remotely with a repository, there isn't a server involved). One of the most popular is RCS (Revision Control System).

>>Every developer has its local version control, no sharing is being done. 

### Centralized version control system
CVCS (like CVS, Subversion and Perforce) permits group collaboration utilizing a single server that contains all the version files, and a number of clients that check out the files from the server. There is only one repository and everybody has their own copy of the code. Everyone knows to a certain degree what everyone else is doing; who wants to make any change in the main code on the server, they have to commit the changes they want to reflect in the central repository and others have tu update it from the server. For many years, this has been the standard control version.

The major drawback is that all versions of the code are on the server, if it goes down, collaboration stops. Or if something happens on the server, everything might be lost unless somebody owns a copy. 

### Distributed version control system 
DVCS, clients mirror the full repository, including its full history (every clone is a full backup of all data); there are multiple repos. If something happens with the server, any of the client's repositories can be copied back up.

As every user has its copy, changes can be made without disturbing the main repository. So that, a commit in each user's local repo and then a push to the remote repo is required. Likewise, to see others user's changes, a pull from the remote repo is required.
