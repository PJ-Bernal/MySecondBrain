[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

FF are not only useful to return objects or functions. FF are useful to wrap sections of code with similar functionality or hide variables and functions that I don't need elsewhere (making them private).

This additional features are available using the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that happens when a FF is wrapped in parenthesis and then is immediately invoked.
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```js
>(function() {
  // function body
})();
>```

The way this functions are invoked immediately is by seeing the parenthesis-wrap FF as a function, thus, the end parenthesis is just how a regular function is invoked. 

## The module pattern
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```js
>const calculator = (function() {
  // Module code
})();
>```

This pattern of wrapping a factory function inside an IIFE is called the module pattern. It combines the ideas of factory functions and IIFEs. This is the basic syntax that creates and immediately executes the FF.  

Ideally, treat modules as closed entities. Meaning, they reside within themselves and nothing more is needed for them to exist. ^578ff9

>- Is quite common to use [[22.5 Anonymous and arrow functions|arrow functions]] as [[22.5 Function expression - function declaration|function expressions]] within the module code, to let the variable that holds the value, call the variable that holds the arrow function like in the example above (when doing `calculator.add()`).
>- Modules must have always a return statement of the object type using `{ }`.
>- Only what is return is part of the public interface and can be use with dot notation using the variable that holds the module. So I can `myModule.publicVar`, but I can't `myModule.privateVar`. 
>- Modules can hold any kind of value type, see the second example in the example title.
>- Modules are useful because they can have private values and functions that can operate the module, without being altered by exterior code.  

This pattern provides a way to create private and public parts of your code, improving organization and reducing the risk of naming conflicts in your JavaScript applications.

```js
const calculator = (function () {
  const add = (a, b) => a + b;
  const sub = (a, b) => a - b;
  const mul = (a, b) => a * b;
  const div = (a, b) => a / b;
  return { add, sub, mul, div };
  // The above code is using the shorthand, remember the original way is
  // return { add: add,   sub: sub,   mul: mul,   div: div };
})();

calculator.add(3,5); // 8
calculator.sub(6,2); // 4
```

Here is an example of how a hard-coded function is within the public interface. It looks odd, but I can do that if I wanted to. 

```js
const myModule = (function() {
  // Private variables and functions
  let privateVar = 'I am private';
  function privateFunction() {
    console.log('This is private');
  }

  // Public interface
  return {
    publicVar: 'I am public',
    publicFunction: function() {
      console.log('This is public');
      privateFunction();
    }
  };
})();
console.log(myModule.publicVar); // I am public
console.log(myModule.publicFunction());
// This is public
// This is private
```

### FF as variables
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20240827145934.png]]

When a FF is store in a variable, the returning values of the return statement becomes the properties of the variable, thus, the variable becomes into an object.





### Modules can be arrow functions
```js
const documentMock = (() => 
(
  {
    querySelector: (selector) => (
      {
        innerHTML: null,
      }
    ),
  }
)
)();
```
## Module pattern benefits
- Encapsulation: Variables and functions inside the IIFE are not accessible from outside, providing privacy; so I can wrap hings that we do not need as private variables and functions inside the FF. 
- Namespace:  It helps avoid polluting the global namespace with many variables and functions.
- Organization: It groups related functionality together.

## Additional examples
```js
const Formatter = (function() {
  const log = (message) => console.log(`[${Date.now()}] Logger: ${message}`);
})();

Formatter.log("Hello");
// VM52:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'log') at <anonymous>:1:11
```

The module is missing the return statement.

```js

const Formatter = (function() {
  const log = (message) => console.log(`[${Date.now()}] Logger: ${message}`);
      return {log};
})();

Formatter.log("Hello");
```

In this example, only the `makeUppercase` function and `timesRun` value are part of the public interface. However, the variable log and the function set times run are being used. 
```js
const Formatter = (function() {
  let timesRun = 0;

  const log = (message) => console.log(`[${Date.now()}] Logger: ${message}`);
  const setTimesRun = () => { 
    log("Setting times run");
    ++timesRun;
  }

  const makeUppercase = (text) => {
    log("Making uppercase");
    setTimesRun();
    return text.toUpperCase();
  };

  return {
    makeUppercase,
    timesRun,
  }
})();

console.log(Formatter.makeUppercase("tomek"));
console.log(Formatter.timesRun);
// [1724862673876] Logger: Making uppercase
// [1724862673876] Logger: Setting times run
// TOMEK
// 0
```
