[[12.10 Docker|Docker]]

When I execute this command to build the docker container `docker container run docker/getting-started`, there isn't a specify port, and the container is running.

When a Docker container runs, it can run either in the foreground (attached mode) or the background (detached mode).

## Foreground (Attached mode)
The standard output and error (stdout, stderr) logs are visible directly in the console. In this mode I can stop the container from running with ctrl + c (the console shows 'everything' the container is doing). This is by default how Docker runs containers. 

## Background (detached mode)
Using the `-d` flag, the container runs as a background of the terminal (if close, the container still runs) process and the logs are not visible in the console. To check the logs use `docker logs <container -id>`. To stop a detached container use `docker container stop <full container id, first three characters of container id or name>`.
## Publish
Makes the container accessible to a port in the local host: `docker run -p <host-port>:<container-port> <image-name>`, for example: `docker container run -dp 8080:80 docker/getting-started`.

## How to know what is the default exposed container port
To know what is the exposed port of a container I can run it in attached mode and then list all the running containers.  

In this example, I have run the getting started and the postgres container; detail by default, they are map to port 80 and 5432.

Remember that port is the container port the container use to communicate with the local host; that port is not the local host of my computer. This means, those container ports are NOT exposed.
