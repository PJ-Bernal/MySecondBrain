[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

[To prevent this behavior](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/css-transitions/#delays-12), use the  `transition-delay` rule. Don't use the shorthand `transition` for this one as is more semantic use the whole rule name. 

```css
.dropdown {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 400ms;
  transition-delay: 300ms;
}

.dropdown-wrapper:hover .dropdown {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 100ms;
  transition-delay: 0ms;
}
```
