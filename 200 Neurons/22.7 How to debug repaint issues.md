[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

[This problem](https://dzhavat.github.io/2021/02/18/debugging-layout-repaint-issues-triggered-by-css-transition.html) is causing a repaint in all elements of the viewport. Check the website for the code. 
 
1. Activate the 'pain flashing' option within the rendering tab of the dev tools. 
2. Check the CSS rules and confirm the element to animate has a span element with all the styling, like [[22.7 Transition flickers|here]].
3. Check if an additional layer was created b the browser to render the element by checking the 'layer borders' within the rendering tab.
4. Check for the stacking context using the 3D view in Edge. 

Sometimes, when an animation is being using the span element, will-change, and there is no an addition layer created, the problem could be the [[22.7 Stacking context|stacking context]]. 

This problem happens because an element with a lower z index value is being render, thus, all of the above elements need to render as well.

To solve this, I need to add a `positio:relative` and a `z-index` value to the span wrapper.
