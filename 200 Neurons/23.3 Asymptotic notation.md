[[13.3 Clean code|Clean code]]

This notation used to describe the running time of an algorithm regardless of its input. There are three main notations:
- Big O Notation - represents the upper bound of an algorithm. This means the worst-case scenario for how the algorithm will perform.
- Omega Notation - represents the lower bound of an algorithm. This is the best-case scenario.
- Theta Notation - represents both the upper bound and lower bound and therefore analyses the average case complexity of an algorithm.

Big O is the one youâ€™ll most commonly see referenced because you need to be sure the worst-case scenario for any code you write is scalable as the inputs grow in your application.
