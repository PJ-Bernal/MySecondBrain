## Functions as Objects and Constructors
>[!blank-container|float-right]
![[Pasted image 20240809131736.png|400]]


In JS, only the objects data type use chain inheritance for attributes and methods. Objects in JS are: Object, Array, Function, Date, RegExp, Error, Set, Map, WeakSet, WeakMap, Promise, etc.

Additionally, the above mentioned _also_ are Constructor Functions (functions use only for creating objects), thus, its `typeof()` is function and not object.

```js
console.log(typeof(Object)); // function
console.log(typeof(Function)); // function
console.log(typeof(Promise)); // function
```

Because this CF are functions and objects at the same type, `Object` and `Function` are the very first links in the prototype and inheritance chain. Thus, any CF is an instance of `Function` and `Object`.

```js
console.log(Function instanceof Function); // true
console.log(Function instanceof Object); // true

console.log(Object instanceof Function); // true
console.log(Object instanceof Object); // true
```

>[!info] Understanding the instanceof operator
>Checks if the `prototype` property of a CF becomes the `[[Prototype]]` chain of an object; the instance of operator don't check for the existence of the constructor of a CF in the `[[Prototype]]` chain; or if the object was created using the `new` keyword. There is no a "visual que" that help to determine if an object is a direct instance of a CF or not, check [[22.5 What is wrong with constructors - Object.setPrototypeOf vs Object.create - changing an objects prototype directly|this example]], specially the parts of using the set prototype of.

>The `instanceOf` operator doesn't check if an object is a direct or indirect instance of their CF. It checks if the prototype of the CF is within the chain of the object.

>An object's prototype can be changed after creation, altering its instanceof results.

>[!info] Functions only instantiate objects
>Though it looks like a function can instantiate other functions (because `Fuction` instantiate the `Array` CF), the reality is that functions can only instantiate objects. Thus CF are both objects and Functions.

>[!warning] Only CF (constructor functions), not abstract classes can instantiate objects
>Though I can think `Node` is a CF, in reality its an abstract class which serves for inheriting purposes. Thus, I can't use it as a CF.
>```js
>const myNode = new Node();
>// Uncaught TypeError: Illegal constructor at anonymous

>[!info] What is a direct and indirect instances
>- Direct: an instance is the object that is created with the `new` keyword, when creating an object from a class.
>- Indirect: object that is the result of a function created without the `new` keyword. When creating a define function.
