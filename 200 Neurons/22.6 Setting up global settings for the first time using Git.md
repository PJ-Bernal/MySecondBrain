[[12.6 Git and Github|Git and Github]]
## Set up Git global settings
This is a basic and general set up to prepare Git for the first time, **without having created the repository or anything**. 

>Remember I can use `man` before git and any command to get the full manual. `man git --global` . Also `git help commit` is the same. 

>[!info]- Review the global configuration file
>>[!multi-column]
>>>To review all global configuration (alias, user, init, etc.). The `-e` flag opens the editor to modify the options. 
>>
>>>```bash
>>>git config --global -e
>>>```

>[!info]- User name and user email
>>[!multi-column]
>>>I have to <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">link my user locally</mark> with Git to work properly and let others know what I and others have committed. To config use the following command:
>>
>>>```bash
>>>git config --global user.name "Your Name"
>>>git config --global user.email "yourname@example.com"
>>>```
>
>>>[!warning]
>>>The email use here must match the same email from GitHub. This is because Git tracks and show my commits based on the user name and email. This is done by Git, so this tracking is made locally. GitHub use my email.

>[!info]- Change the main branch name
>>[!multi-column]
>>>GItHub changed the default branch from `master` to `main`. Main is the default name, but it could have any name. This change is global, meaning, from now on all the branches I create will have that name. The second command changes the name of the current branch. 
>>>
>>
>>>```bash
>>>git config --global init.defaultBranch main
>>>
>>>git branch -m old_name new_name 
>>>```

>[!info]- Enable colorful UI
>>[!multi-column]
>>>To enable <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">colorful output</mark> The color config can be change, [check this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10998792/how-to-color-the-git-console). I can also add specific colors to commands, check [color.*](https://git-scm.com/book/sv/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration)
>>
>>>```bash
>>>git config --global color.ui auto

>[!info]- Set default reconciliation behavior to merge
>>[!multi-column]
>>
>>>To set the default branch reconciliation behavior to mergin.
>>
>>>```bash
>>>git config --global pull.rebase false

>[!info]- Set a default code editor 
>>[!multi-column]
>>
>>>Change it place a desire code editor when editing, for example, the global settings, or resolving merge conflicts with VSCode. The `--wait` flag  instructs Git to wait until the editor is closed before proceeding with the next Git command. This can be useful when you're editing commit messages or resolving merge conflicts
>>
>>>```bash
>>>git config --global core.editor code --wait

>[!info]- Use `get` to verify any global setting
>>[!multi-column]
>>
>>>To verify, for example, the user credentials.
>>
>>>```bash
>>>git config --get user.name>>>git config --get user.email

>[!info]- Create a commit template
>>[!multi-column]
>>
>>>To create a commit template, create a `.gitmessage.txt` file. By executing the command `git commit` Git will open the default code editor to display the commit. The template I use is [this](https://gist.github.com/lisawolderiksen/a7b99d94c92c6671181611be1641c733) and where the file should be locate is my call. In this example, the file is within the root directory of the project.
>>
>>>```bash
>>>git config --global commit.template .gitmessage.txt
