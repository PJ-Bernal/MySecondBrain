# Uniform Interface
The API and its consumers share a single technical (but consistent and predictable) interface, to decouple and simplify the architecture allowing each system to evolve independently. 

REST uses HTTP, the interface is a combination of:
- Resource-base URLs: each resource is identify by a unique URL - where I can find the resource.
- HTTP methods - how can the consumer interact with the resource. 
- HTTP media types: the representation of the resources, json or xml for example, when making a request to the server, or sending a request to the user. Is defined by the media type in the body. 
## Example
### Get method
A GET method doesn't have a payload, but it could have a media type by setting the Accept header; Doing this states that the consumer of the API wants a payload in response back in JSON format. 

This request is REST: it have a resource, a method and a media type.

### Post method
The request body (JSON format) is the payload.

Also the body headers not only contain the Accept, but also the Content-type, sos the API knows how to parse the content by looking at the header.

# Uniform interface sub-constrains
## Identification of resources
The resources themselves are conceptually separate from the representations that are return to the client, this means:
- The resource is the abstract entity on the server. It exists independently of how it is represented.
- For example, a "user" resource might have properties like id, name, and email, but these properties are not tied to any specific format (e.g., JSON, XML).
- The same resource can have multiple representations in format (xml, json, etc.) and content (see the images below). 
	- The server can change how its db fields are sent to the consumer, to better fit their necessities. Both the format and the content, both could be different from the server's internal representation. 


```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

```xml
<user>
    <id>1</id>
    <name>John Doe</name>
    <email>john@example.com</email>
</user>
```

This is important because:
- Flexibility: the server can provide multiple representations (json, xml, html, etc.) of the same resource depending on the client needs.
- Decoupling: the client and server are decoupled because the client only interacts with the representation of the resource, not the resource itself. This allows the server to change how resources are stored or managed internally without affecting the client.

This example show the powerful of this sub-constrain. Detail when making a request, the JSON has a name and age properties.

But when the request is created, the body's request has a first name, last name and date of birth.

>- The server doesn't have to send an entity (a db row as is) from its db back or a combination of multiple fields. Because in this example, the author resource (the resource that is sent back to the consumer) doesn't necessarily map to an author in a db.
>- The db don't have a name field, but a first name and last name; similarly, the db don't have an age field, it has a date of birth field. 
>- The db fields are completely different from what the server can send to the user.

## Manipulation of resources through representations
When a client holds a representation of a resource including their metadata, it must have enough information to modify the resource on the server. The way the client manipulate the resource is by sending a representation of the desire state of the resource to the server.

For example, this GET response provides an author resource that's holding an ID, so in theory the consumer can construct the URI to send, for example, a PATCH request to modify the resource. 

However, a resource is identify on the server with its full URI, and not only its ID.  The URI includes the protocol, domain, path, and the ID; without the full URI the consumer can't interact directly with the resource.

To adhere to this principle the resource should include metadata with hyperlinks on how to modify resource. This API supports that, requesting an `application/vnd.marvin.hateoas+json`.

Now, the response have the resource and its metadata in form of valid URI.

## Self-descriptive message
Each message (request or response) exchanged between the client and server must contain all the information necessary for the recipient to understand and process it. Each message has headers and a body. 

For example, if the request message body is JSON representation of the resource, its headers must specify that by including the media type through the content type header.

Thanks to that, the correct parser can be invoked to process the request body, and be serialized to the correct class.
## Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)
The consumer interact with the API entirely through hypermedia links (provided by the server) that describe how to delete, update, create or where to find a resource. 

The server guides the client through the API by including link in its response, and the user use those to navigate and perform actions.

Detail the image above when making a **GET** request, the resource include hypermedia links to create a course for an author, and a another link to get all the courses. The client and server are loosely coupled. The server can change URIs or add new features without breaking the client, as long as the links are updated.

This principle encourage a self-documented API.
