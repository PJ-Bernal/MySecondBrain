## Operators, operands, unary and binary
- Operand: any type of binding, value or expression.
- Operator: is what creates the operation (+, -,`*`, etc.). It can be unary, binary o ternary.

>[!example] Unary and binary operators
>```JS
>let x = 10; 
>x *= x; // Example of unary operator.
>let y = 20;
> alert(x – y);// Example of binary operator. 
>```

## Operator precedence
Higher precedence operators are done first. A general order: parenthesis, postfix/prefix increment/decrement, multiplication, division, subtraction, addition, assignment. [Operator Precedence Values]( https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_precedence.asp)

When operators have the **same precedence**, the interpreter will read the code from **left to right**. 

The assignment operator has lower precedence than most of the operators. So, when declaring a value, all the calculations are done first and them the = is evaluated.

>[!example]
>```JS
> let x = 2 * 2 + 1;
>First the calculations are done, then the assignation.
>``` 
## Increment and decrement operators

>>```
### Postfixed operator
Returns the current operand's value **first**, then the increment/decrement is applied, meaning, the operator is affected by the operand ‘after’.

```JS
// a is assigned to 1, and then counter increases. a is never going to increment. 
let counter = 1;
let a = counter++; // (*) changed ++counter to counter++
alert(counter); // 2
alert(a); // 1
alert(a); // 1

// With self-increment values, I have to request twice the operand 
let z = 10; 
z++; // Output: 10
z; // Output: 11
```

>[!example] Detail this example
>```JS
>let a = 10;
>let z = 2 * a++; // Up to this point, the increment already take place, but in the previous specific line NOT. Thus, this happens.
>console.log(a); // Output: 11
>console.log(z); //Output: 20. When I’m calling z, on that line the increment haven’t happened, thus the result is 20, not 22. 
>```

>[!warning]
Post and prefixes have higher precedence than other operators, and they should not be included within expressions. 
>>[!example]
>>```JS
>>let counter = 1;
>>alert( 2 * ++counter ); // 4
>>
>>let counter = 1;
>>alert( 2 * counter++ ); // 2
>>/* In the last example Im using the ‘old value’. */
>>
>>/*Better do this.*/ 
>>Alert( 2 * counter); 
>>counter ++;
>>```
## Expressions
Fragment of code that produce a value. Primitive values, expressions between parenthesis, a binary operator applied to two expressions or a unary operator apply to one are expressions. They don't have a return value perse, but they resolve to a value. 

```JS
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
let c = 3 - (a = b + 1); // This parenthesis returns a unique value, not an expression. 
// This shouldn’t be use as difficult code readability. 
alert( a ); // 3
alert( c ); // 0
```
## Chaining assignments
Chained assignments evaluate from right to left. 
```JS
let a, b, c;
a = b = c = 2 + 2;
alert( a ); // 4
alert( b ); // 4
alert( c ); // 4
```

## Assignment operators
There are several types like +=, -=, `*=`, /=, [this is the complete list](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_precedence.asp). They require operands (either a variable or value) on both sides: like: `x /= y;`: However, the right operand can be an expression: `n /= 3 + 5’;`.

## Comparison operators
Comparison operators are equality == === != !== and comparisons < > <= >=.  ^492f94

![[22.5 Comparisons - null and undefined comparison and casting - null vs zero#^45d4f1]]
### Strict equal
Strict equal: === `!==` test if the values and datatypes are equal or not equal, without any type conversion. Is a good practice to use strict comparison over loose comparison.

>[!example]
>```JS
>alert(5=== 2 + 4); // Output: false;
>alert(5 === 2 + 3); // Output: true;
>alert(5 === ‘5’); // Output: false
>```

>[!example]
>```JS
>alert(5 !== 2 + 3); // Output: false;
>alert(5 !== 2 + 1); // Output: true;
>```

### Equal
== and !=, tests if the values, not the datatypes, are the same by converting the operators to numbers. 

>[!example]
>```JS
>alert(5 == ‘5’); // Output: true.
alert( '' == false ); // true. Space becomes 0 and false 0.

## Comma operator
Evaluates **each** of its operands (from left to right) and **returns** the value of the last operand.

>[!example]
>```JS
>let a = (1 + 2, 3 + 4);
>alert( a ); // 7 (the result of 3 + 4)
>```

Comma has the lowest precedence, lower than =, thus, parenthesis is required when using this operator. If not used, the expression is going to thrown an error because the assignation is higher precedence and will happen first. 

### Use cases
- To build up a variable.

```JS
// Allow to include multiple expressions in the same place. 
let a = 5;
let ans = (a = 8, a++, a += 2);
output.innerHTML = "The value of the ans variable is: " + ans; // 11

//Complex constructors, when a set of variables can be define first, then used and thrown away. 
for (a = 1, b = 3, c = a * b; a < 10; a++) {
 ...
}
```

- To execute multiple functions at once.

```JS
let output = document.getElementById("output");
function first() {
  output.innerHTML += "The first function is called! <br/>";
  return 1;
}

function second() {
  output.innerHTML += "The second function is called! <br/>";
  return 2;
  }

let ans = (first(), second());
output.innerHTML += "The value of the ans variable is: " + ans; 
//The first function is called!
//The second function is called!
//The value of the ans variable is: 2
```

## typeof operator
Returns a string with the type of operand; is useful to check value types. It has two valid syntaxes: `typeof(x)` or `typeof x`. `typeof null // 'object'` This is an error

## Null coalescing operator
Returns the right-hand side operand when the left-hand side operand is null or undefined. 

```javascript
function showCount(count) {
  // if count is undefined or null, show "unknown"
  alert(count ?? "unknown");
}

showCount(0); // 0
showCount(null); // unknown
showCount(); // unknown
```

## Nullish coalescing assignment
Only evaluates the right operand and assigns to the left if the left operand is null or undefined. Useful to build up objects and give them default values. 

```js
const a = { duration: 50 };

a.speed ??= 25;
console.log(a.speed); // 25 On this point the object has a new speed property added

a.duration ??= 10;
console.log(a.duration); //  50 Duration is not altered as it was there already
```

When a function uses an object as a parameter, there's no direct way to declare default values, unless using the nullish coalescing operator.

```js
function config(options) {
  options.duration ??= 100;
  options.speed ??= 25;
  return options;
}

config({ duration: 125 }); // { duration: 125, speed: 25 }
config({}); // { duration: 100, speed: 25 }
```
## Spread operator
The spread (`...`) syntax allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected.

```javascript
function sum(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(sum(...numbers));
// Expected output: 6

function myFunction(x, y, z) { console.log(x, y, z)}
const args = [0, 1, 2];
myFunction(...args); // 0 1 2
```
