[[13.1 OO Programming|OOP]]

>[!info]- OO way as a base
>OO thinking is the based of all of this topics: OO analysis, OO design, OO programming, design patterns, OO data (XML), the Unified Modeling Language (UML), OO web development, OO mobile development, various OO programming languages, and many other topics related to OO programming (OOP).

Learning and working with OOP equires separating languages, development practices and tools from the OO thought process. Also, separating learning OO concepts (the first and most important step) from programming in an OO language  (less important). is important the former is even more important than the latter. 

>[!quote]- 
>Quite often developers who claim to be C++ programmers are simply C programmers using C++ compilers.

The key to using code while learning OOP is not to focus on the language, but use it to understand the concepts. 

Learning OO implies learning concepts (evolve, they do change), not technologies (change quickly in the industry).
## The fundamental concepts
Learning OO implies thinking about how the concepts are used in designing object-oriented systems. Only the concepts should be enough for making important design decisions. 

>[!important]
>- Classic OO is defined by: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and composition. If a language doesn't include the first three, is not completely OO.
>- OOP focuses on classes and objects, rather than functions and logic. 
>- With OO, the business model is easier to program, update , and maintain; offer extensive reusability.

>[!warning]- How do these concepts relate to the always-changing design patterns?
>
>This surfaces a problem. For example, when using inheritance in an OO design. Does it break encapsulation? This question makes developers try to avoid using inheritance, so, should it be used at all? 
>
>To solve this, stick to the concepts to make an educated design choice. 
## Objects and legacy systems
A line between OO and structure (or procedural) programming shouldn't exist, they complement each other [question:: how objects integrate well with structured code]. OO code is not meant to replace structured code (there is nothing wrong with it), although in some cases there is no other choice. [question:: differences, advantages and disadvantages of structure and OO programming]

>[!multi-column]

>Legacy concerns exist, however, there is a trend to wrap legacy systems in object wrappers.  
>
>>Object wrappers
>>OO code that includes other code inside, for example, taking loops and conditions from structured code and wrapping it inside an object to make it look like an object 

[question:: How do object wrappers work in OO and Java]

## Procedural paradigms
In OO, both (the word both is the key difference) attributes (data) and methods are contained within a single object. Whereas in procedural, or structural, the attributes and behaviors are normally separated. [question:: Search a little bit more about the difference between procedural and OO programming]
### Procedural
Analysis is action oriented, problems are usually break and solve in terms of steps or process, therefore, this was the first way of programming, everything were actions. 

Now, a longer process involves longer actions, and it becomes hard to debug; generally, the problem won't be find easily, there is no initial point to search, so a line by line analysis will ve required. Nonetheless, on the contrary many could thinkg, procedural code can be re-usaable, but it'll be much harder to implemented in larger proyects.

Usually, data is global so it's easy to modify data that is outside the scope of my code; therefore, data access is uncontrolled and unpredictable, as testing and debugging more difficult.

>OO programming rather than following a sequence of steps, describes the objects and their capabilities. The program transforms from a single-oriented program to several self-contained objects (like mini-programs) each one containing its own data and logic to describe is behavior and relation with other objects.
>This allows each object to be used only when it's required. 

>[!info]
>There are two big requiremenets for proper OOP:
>1. Methods and its attributes are stored in the same class. Method's parameters should only be needed if they use data that is not normally attributed to the class. The method depends on the data in the object at the time the method is executed (the method depends on the object state).

One of the biggest advantages of OOP is code reusability. Let's say I have the objects to create a cake. Can I make muffins? Yes, I already have the mixer, pan and oven object; only a new object, the muffin tray, will be required. 

OO allows control access to members of an object (attributes and methods), meaning some members can be hidden from other objects (data hiding). 

>[!example]-
>Imagine an object called 'Math' that contains two integers, the methods to set and retrieve the integers values, and one to calculate the sum. Now, thanks to encapsulation, only the math object can manipulate the integers.
>
>If another object wants to interact with the math object, it must call the math sum method, and then, the sum method returns the value to the other object.  

Objects don't need to know code implementation when calling a method of another object, only the interface is shown. Therefore, the method implementation could change without changing the other object per se.   ^78b1bb

Also, when properly designed, there is no such thing as global data in OO model, this provides data integrity.  
#### Incomplete truths
>[!info]- OO development was created to make code more reusable
>Procedural code is action oriented, that doesn't mean you can't break a problem down into many actions and re-use them.
>>[!example]-
>>Consider a baking recipe, I have a recipe for making buns that contains the actions I need to perform to finish them as cinnamon buns. However I also have the option of turning them into cheese buns by following the cheese process instead. I don't have 2 entire recipe's, I just follow different actions at the end, The actions have different parameters, cheese instead of cinnamon.
>>Of course If I were writing this recipe to share I would need to plan more carefully how the actions could be re-used. Can the cheese action be re-used on say Mini Pizzas for the kids? Not without careful planning and documentation 

>[!info]- Procedural is sequential, so they made OO development

### Functional
Everything is an action (as in procedural), but the main difference is that all actions are also data. When you call an action, you supply the actions it needs as parameters to execute and perform other actions.
