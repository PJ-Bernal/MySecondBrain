[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

Constructor parameters can be of any data type value, this include instances of other classes. I can do this in two approaches. 

Dependency injection:

```js
class AdminUserManager {
  constructor(userCRUD, reportGenerator, userCommunication) {
    this.userCRUD = userCRUD;
    this.reportGenerator = reportGenerator;
    this.userCommunication = userCommunication;
  }
}
```

Creating instances inside of the constructor:

```js
class AdminUserManager {
  constructor(UserCRUD, ReportGenerator, UserCommunication) {
    this.userCRUD = new UserCRUD();
    this.reportGenerator = new ReportGenerator();
    this.userCommunication = new UserCommunication();
  }
}
```

There are some differences, but in general the first approach is better, but approach two could be useful as well. 
1. Approach 2 creates a tighter coupling between AdminUserManager and its dependencies.
2. It's harder to test because you can't easily substitute mock objects.
3. Approach 1 allow me to use created instances.
