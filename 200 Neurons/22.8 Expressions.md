>Expressions are anything that has a value or that evaluates to a value, for example, constants, variables and literals.
>
>```PHP
>$x = 5; // 5 is a literal that evaluates to itself
>$y = $x;// this is another expression
>$z = $x === $y; // the comparison is another expression because it gets evaluated

Pretty much anything after the assignment operator is an expression, because it evaluates to some kind of value of any data type. Functions are considered expressions because they return a value. 

```PHP
$x = sum($z, $y); // this is an expressions
if ($x < 5){...}// The comparison is an expression
```
