[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

When working with bundlers like webpack, two folders are important:
- src (source): where all source code is, but the configuration files.
- dist (distribution): minimize code and optimize `output` of the bundled process that will be loaded in the browser.

The idea is when someone fork or clone the project the dist directory is not needed as they'd be able to run webpack to from src into their own dist. Similarly, to deploy our website, we would only need the dist code and nothing else. Keep that in mind! Work inside src, build into dist, then deploy from there!

So, my project must have a src directory `mkdir src`.
