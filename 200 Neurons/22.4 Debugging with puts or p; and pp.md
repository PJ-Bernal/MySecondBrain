[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

If an error is not raise but the output is unexpected, I can include some puts or p in the code to confirm the output of the code.

```ruby
irb(main):001:1* def isogram?(string)
irb(main):002:1*   original_length = string.length
irb(main):003:1*   string_array = string.downcase.split
irb(main):004:1*
irb(main):005:1*   p string_array
irb(main):006:1*
irb(main):007:1*   unique_length = string_array.uniq.length
irb(main):008:1*
irb(main):009:1*   p unique_length
irb(main):010:1*
irb(main):011:1*   original_length == unique_length
irb(main):012:0> end
=> :isogram?
irb(main):013:0> isogram?("Odin")
["odin"]
1
=> false
```

In this case, if split doesn't have any arguments, it will divide the string using white space as a delimiter. In this case odin is one word, so the string is not split. Having for example 'odin two' will create ["odin", "two"].

## Be mindful of nil
If the puts argument is nil, then the terminal will print a blank line. Instead, use p that will print a string representation of whatever.

```ruby
puts "Using puts:"
puts []
p "Using p:"
p []
# puts "Using puts:"
# puts []
# p "Using p:"
# p []
```

## Remember to use the pp library
For complex data types, I can use the pretty print library.

```ruby
require 'pp'
pp object
```

## Check the class and the methods 
Sometimes I need to check what the class is or the methods are:

```ruby
p object.class
p object.methods
```
