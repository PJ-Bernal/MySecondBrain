[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

## What are Ruby Gems?
Gems refer to: a Ruby package or library; and the publishing system to manipulate those packages or libraries. It's a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries in a self-contained format; containing code, documentation, and tests, all neatly packaged together.

All of this works under a publishing system powered by the website [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/). And it's integrated in Ruby since 1.9. 

>Gems have versions based on the Semantic Versioning standard. A gem is said to have been "cut" when a new version becomes available.

## How to use them
Use the `gem` command to use Gems. Combine with `install` to download and install gems with their dependencies and relevant documentation, from the ruby gems website. `gem install <gem name>`

>Installing gems like this is fine for one-time usage, but I can lose track easily of which gems belong to my project. Thus a `Gemfile` is required, to have all my dependencies in a central location.
