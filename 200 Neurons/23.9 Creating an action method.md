# Create an action method
## Create instances of the mode
The list method will go to the repository and ask for all the pies, therefore, the controller need to use the repositories of the model (its interface). First, create fields of the needed type, and to be able to use DI, the fields need to be initialized in a constructor.

## Creating action methods
The type of the method is `IActionResult` which is an interface that provides flexibility as it allows to return different kinds of results: Web pages (ViewResult), JSON data (JsonResult), Files (FileResult), HTTP status codes (StatusCodeResult), Redirects (RedirectResult).

Not all action methods need to return that type, but is the most flexible one, so that why is use. They can use fixed types like int, string, etc.

Is the controller responsibility to pass data to the view to render. The most common way to do this is using the `ViewBag` which is a dynamic object to attach data to, from the controller. The object can be loaded with any amount of properties of any name. 

In this example, the data is added to the Message property.
