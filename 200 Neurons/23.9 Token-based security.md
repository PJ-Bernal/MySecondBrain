# About tokens
Checking for a user name and password in every request is a bad practice. Is better to use and send tokens in each request, that represent a consent, that is passed and validated to the API. 
# Creating tokens
To create a token is common to create an endpoint in the API that accepts a username and password, if valid, a token can be returned from the call. 

Use POST method for accessing token endpoints with the username and password in the request body. Because webservers log request URLs, but not request bodies, and I don't want the username and password ending up in the web server logs.

Also, ensure the API can only be accessed with a valid token. Hence, the consumer must send the token on each request to gain access; tokens are send to the api as Bearer tokens by setting the authorization header value of the request to Bearer, followed by the token. 
# Token structure
A `JWTSecurityToken` is an object that represents a Json Web Token, it contains a header, payload (claims) and a signature.

Header: essential token information like the algorithm used for signing, that can be used for the receiver of the token for parsing and validating.

Payload: json that contains token info (creation date and user info), about the user. Includes the claims.

Signature: hash on the payload to ensure data wasn't tampered. For example, if someone alters the payload after the signature was created, then the signature won't match payload anymore, meaning, someone alter it. The signature require a key which is generated by a secret

# About token security
The reason a token can be copied and pasted into jwt.io is because tokens are encoded but not encrypted. Meaning token relies on the HTTPS for encryption, HTTPS is a must.
