# About tokens
Checking for a user name and password in every request is a bad practice. Is better to use and send tokens in each request, that represent a consent, that is passed and validated to the API. 

Authentication: verify who the user is. Authorization: what the consumer is able to do. 

Tokens can be app specific which make them like API keys, or user specific. In this case, the consumer username and password are exchanged for a token, which contains information about the user, like the id, and the token itself, like the expiration, access rights, etc. The most common type of token is the JWT, Json Web Token. 

At the API level an action method is defined that takes username and password, validates it, generates a JWT and returns that token to the client. Then, the client provide that token on each request to the API, as a bearer token in the authorization header, and it gets validated in the API. 
# Creating tokens
To create a token is common to create an endpoint in the API that accepts a username and password, if valid, a token can be returned from the call. 

Use POST method for accessing token endpoints with the username and password in the request body. Because webservers log request URLs, but not request bodies, and I don't want the username and password ending up in the web server logs.

Also, ensure the API can only be accessed with a valid token. Hence, the consumer must send the token on each request to gain access; tokens are send to the api as Bearer tokens by setting the authorization header value of the request to Bearer, followed by the token. 
# Token structure
A `JWTSecurityToken` is an object that represents a Json Web Token, it contains a header, payload (claims) and a signature, which are separated by a .

Header: contains information the received of the token can use to know about essential token information, for parsing and validating. This information could be the type of token and the algorithm to generate the signature.

Payload: json that contains generic token info (information about the user), and its capabilities on the API, which are called claims. For example, sub, name, and iat are claims. 
Some claims are standard, like jti, sub; others are created like email, userid, etc. The payload must not contain any secrets.

Signature: is the hash of the payload to ensure data wasn't tampered. For example, if someone alters the payload after the signature was created, then the signature won't match payload anymore, meaning, someone alter it. The signature require a key which is generated by a secret.

# About token security
The reason a token can be copied and pasted into jwt.io is because tokens are encoded but not encrypted. Meaning token relies on the HTTPS for encryption, HTTPS is a must.
