## How to access static attributes
To access static properties and method I must use the scope resolution operator `::` (though I can use `->` to call static methods, but this is not recommended because I won't know if the method/attribute is static). So, within index.php:

>>I don't need an object to access static methods and properties of the class because there're not created and associated per object, they are created and are associated on class basis; they belong to the class and not a particular instance of it.

>>Here I'm using the class name `Transaction` instead of the object `$transaction`
## 'Regular' attributes vs static attributes
>Regular class attributes (amount and description in this case), every time I create an instance, those properties get created and associated to that specific object. 

>Static properties could be think as global variables, because their values are shared across the objects, they are tied to the class itself, not to an object. 

## Referencing static methos or attributes from within the class
To reference static attributes I can use either `self::` or `<class name>::`.

In the main script I have one single object, thus, count is incremented by one. 

![[Pasted image 20240313125007.png]]

However, every time I create an object, the constructor will be called, thus, if I have 5 objects, then the attribute value is going to change:

![[Pasted image 20240313125032.png]]

So, the value is share and is globally accessible, I don't need an instance of the class, I can use it using the class itself. In this example all the objects are commented so the count is zero.

### Private static property
When private it throws an error. This makes the variable accessible only within the method. 

![[Pasted image 20240313125303.png|center|300]]

![[Pasted image 20240313125321.png]]

To fix this I can add a static method, that contains the static keyword.

## `$this` on static methods is not available 
Because the access of static methods doesn't require an instance of the class and they belong to the class itself, `$this` is not available within static methods.

![[Pasted image 20240313125538.png]]

That makes sense because the `$this` variable refers to the calling objects, but in statics I really don't have an object. So I have to use the self keyword. 

## Resolution operator on a non static property/method
That will cause an error, because the static property amount doesn't exists. In this case, amount is not a static attribute, so I can't call it using the scope resolution. 

![[Pasted image 20240313125838.png]]

The same rule applies to static methods.

## Use cases for static methods and properties
The use of static methods or properties is generally consider a **bad practice**, but there are some use cases.
### To have a counter or cache values
This refers to the same use in [[22.8 Variable scope and static variables#Static variables|here]], in which I can speed up expensive operations by caching the result for later access with a process called memorization. [[22.8 Variable scope and static variables#Static variables|this is an example of memorization]]. 
### To implement the singleton pattern
This pattern maintains a single instance of a given class throughout my app execution.  Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VVN-2SCx7Q&list=PLr3d3QYzkw2xabQRUpcZ_IBk9W50M9pe-&index=41) min 5:40 for a full explanation about this. Using singleton pattern is not the best way, but dependency injection. 
### To create utility methods that don't need instance of the class
For example a formatted class that have some formatter methods for formatting a currency, amount. etc. This methods don't depend on the object, so they don't depend on an instance of a class, is convenient to have this method as static. 
### Factory pattern
Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VVN-2SCx7Q&list=PLr3d3QYzkw2xabQRUpcZ_IBk9W50M9pe-&index=41) min 9 for a full explanation about this. 

## Why avoid static attributes and methods?
Because they produce some sort of global state in which I can modify the data or call a static function anywhere in the code; which can make things harder to maintain and test. 

Instead of use statics, better use dependency injection. 

## I can have static callbacks and closures

>When using a callback, like `function() {}`, I can make it static adding the word `static` at the beginning. Thus, the `$this` keyword can't be use within the callback, so I can't access class attributes.

If I remove the static keyword from the method, everything works, but now I can modify the state of the object.
