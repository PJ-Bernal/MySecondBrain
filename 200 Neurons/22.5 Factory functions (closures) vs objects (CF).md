[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

This are some differences between using FF and Objects (Constructor Functions).

## Memory efficiency
- If the properties or methods in CF are added to the CF `prototype`, closures and CF have almost the same memory-efficiency. Different story if the methods or properties are added in the CF definition (using `this`), where objects are less memory-efficient.

## Data privacy
I can have [[22.5 Data privacy with closures|private data]] with closures that can't be accessed from outside the closure. With objects, all properties and methods are accessible using dot or notation syntax (unless using patterns like symbols or weakmaps).

## Syntax and creation
Closures are created implicitly when a function is defined inside another function and retains access to its outer scope. Objects are typically created explicitly using object literals, constructor functions, or classes.

## Functionality
Closures are primarily about encapsulating functionality with its relevant data. Objects are more about modeling entities with properties and methods.

## Inheritance and prototypes
Objects created with constructor functions or classes can easily implement inheritance through prototypes. Closures don't have a built-in inheritance mechanism, but they can use a different approach to use inheritance, check [[22.5 Inheritance with FF|this note]]. 

## This and context
Methods in objects have their own this context, which can be both powerful and sometimes tricky. Closures don't deal with this binding in the same way.

```js
// Using a closure
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    return function() {
        return ++count;
    };
}

const counter1 = createCounter();
console.log(counter1()); // 1
console.log(counter1()); // 2

// Using an object
function Counter() {
    this.count = 0;
    this.increment = function() {
        return ++this.count;
    };
}

const counter2 = new Counter();
console.log(counter2.increment()); // 1
console.log(counter2.increment()); // 2
```
