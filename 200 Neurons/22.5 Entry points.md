[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

With ESM I don't have to import every single file, but one, the entry point. This is the file that "initiates" the dependency chain. In the examples using in named and default exports, that will be `two.js`.

```
importer  depends on  exporter
two.js <-------------- one.js
```

For [[22.5 Webpack core concepts#Entry points|webpack entry points]], this definition is a little bit more detail.

When loading an entry point file the browser will check it depends on other file, `one.js` in this example, and it will load that file as well. 

The entry point file is unique, is only one file. And the script tag needs to include `type="module"` that already includes the `defer` flag. 

```html
<script src="two.js" type="module"></script>
```
