[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

The `display: contents` don't render the border box model, "the container" of the element, and its children take place in the layout. The element is still in the DOM, but its box model disappears, so all of its box properties like background, border, padding and margin have no effect. 

In this example, the container have some styles, margin and adding added.

However, with `display: contents` is present, the box model render disappears, but the element **is still** present in the DOM. Detail the mouse is hovering the element, but nothing is shown in the webpage.

It can be use with any layout: normal, flex, or grid7

>This value don't work properly with replaced elements like img, video, canvas, input, etc.

## Use case
1. To let a flex property applied to children wrap within a container. This doesn't require the container to have a display flex and be treated as a flex container.
>[!blank-container|float-left]

Expected behavior as the gap is applied to the child elements of the flexbox container that is the nav. So, when using the display contents, detail how the children of the div can now use the gap.

Now, I can use flexbox properties directly onto the children, for example:

```css
input {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

To let only the input to grow. 

The element still exists in the DOM so is JS manipulable.
