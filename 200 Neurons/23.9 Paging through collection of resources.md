# About paging
Paging are parameters (not a resource by itself) typically passed via a query string, use to manipulate the resource collection. The consumer should be ale to choose the page number and page size, for example: `https://host/api/authors?pageNumber=1&pageSize=5`

The page size must be limited to a fixed number. If no paging parameters are passed, is common to return a first page with a fix number of results. Also, paging must go all the way through the db.  
# Implementing paging

The og code.

## Adding the parameters for paging
Looking at the method signature, the paging size and number parameters can be added to the `AuthorsResourceParameters`, giving the parameters default values. Also, define a constant for the maximum page size differentiate per collection, for example, a maximum of 10 authors, but 20 courses.

Now, use a private field and a property to set the page size, to check if its higher than the maximum.

## Updating the controller
Detail is the repo class that implements filtering, searching, and pagination. This is not responsibility of the controller, because paging must be done at db level. 

Following the referred execution principle, add paging before callint `ToListAsync`, and last, after paging and searching; if added first, the where and other methods will be executed in a smalll, paginated, set of data.

First, skip an amount of authors, this grants if, for example, page 2 is requested, the authors in page 1 are skipped; then take the page size.

Also, delete the if clause that return all authors if both any of the query string parameters for filter and searching are null or empty; because paging must be apply no matter what.

At this moment, no metadata from the return collection is being send to the consumer. 
# Testing
To confirm the paging is working detail the sql statements, the limit and offset parameters.
