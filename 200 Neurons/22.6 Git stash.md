## Stash area
Area in which I can save code that hasn't been committed yet, and leave the current branch unaltered; it should be considered only as a temporary state. Like a backroom. Is not a good practice to have multiple register within the stash area, is not easy to track  and remember every registry. 

>In theory, using stash is not required because if I'm developing a new feature, I should coding in a branch.

I can use stash to easily go to a raw commit state, this means, if I created or modify files and folders, I can simply stashed them to get the actual commit state of the cwd.

I can use the `git stash clear` command to delete all files and folders within the stash area. 

## Stash conflicts
When the same line has been stashed and then popped, Git shows a conflict.

Detail the pop didn't take place and Git is waiting for me to resolve the conflict.

The list is not that useful as I don't really know what happened on each stash.
