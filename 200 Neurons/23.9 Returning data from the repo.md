The notes up to this point show how to retrieve in-memory data within the controllers class. This note will show how to retrieve data from the repository.

# Injecting the repo interface in the controller
Use constructor injection to inject the repository interface, using a private read only field.

# Return data from the repo
## Calling the required method from the repo
The repo methods' signature are async code, therefore, it returns a task; so the action methods of the controller must be async, and the call to the async method of the interfaces needs to be awaited.

Up to this point, the city dto class has an id, name, description, and number of poi, properties. 

## About the return type and the model classes
>[!important]
>- The return value of the whole action method must be the type of entity class.
>- Actions in the API should return entities (from entity classes) objects. 

`cityEntities` return value is the type `Entities.city`, meaning the return value is referring to [[23.9 Repository pattern#^b82f37|this repository method]] where context is [[23.9 Creating a db context#^91d57a|this type]], meaning, the `cityEntities` return value is in reality [[23.9 Creating entity classes#^1b2411|this entity class]]. 

With this in mind, the current action method signature is returning a `CityDto` object, which includes the calculated property number of points of interest, and the `cityEntities` is returning an instances of the city entity that does not contain this point of interest property. 

If I left the signature as is, number of points of interest will always be an empty array. Therefore, is required to add a new Dto.

Now change the return type of the action method to the new Dto.![[Pasted image 20250124090107.png]]

Now, city entities is an enum, so the code create an empty instance of the city without points of interest dto, and then use the for each method to map each enum item to this new class, to create objects with the data provided by each enum.

Detail the return type is NOT an entity class instance, but another dto.

>[!important]
>Complex object, that have properties inside properties inside properties could be difficult to map when creating the object and mapping its properties like in the above example `Id = cityEntities.Id`, etc.

## Why do I have to return another DTO if that DTO and the entity class have almost the exact same properties?
Is common to return DTO classes instead of entity classes when returning data from an API. Using DTOs allows for better API design and separation of concerns. 

Usually the entity classes likely contains more data what the API needs to return. The DTO classes are in charge of exposing only what is require without exposing the internal structure of the entities. 

If the API needs to return different subsets of city data in the future, you can create additional DTOs without affecting the core entity class

The API can evolve independently from the underlying data model. Changes to the City entity do not necessarily require changes to the API contract
