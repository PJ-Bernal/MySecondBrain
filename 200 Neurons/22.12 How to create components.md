[[12.12 React|React]]

Components are JS functions that return JSX (this is not HTML), whose name must be capitalized or they will not function as expected. React uses the capitalization to tell the difference between an HTML tag and an instance of a React component. 

```jsx
//Greeting.jsx
function Greeting() {
    return <h1>&quot;I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.&quot;</h1>;
}
```

>[!error] Linter and escape sequences
>Some characters needs to be escaped. For example, the linter mark " as an error, so `&quot;` escape sequence must be used to generate ".  Use [this tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/free-online-tools/html-escape) to escape HTML sequences.
>
>This happens because in JSX, all attribute values use single or double quotes.
