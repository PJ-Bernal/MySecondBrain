## Setting the method
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```js
>fetch('https://api.example.com/data',{
>  method: 'POST',
>  })
>```

Default `GET`, but can use [any other](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) HTTP request. If `mode: no-cors`, the request is [[22.2 HTTP security#Safe requests|safe]], and the method must be POST, GET or HEAD.

For POST methods the code must define the headers and the body. 
## Setting the body
The body is the data being send in the request to the server, thus, GET shouldn't have a body; but POST, PUT or PATCH request. In this payload I can send anything, JSON, form data, files and plain text. [This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#setting_a_body) list show the instances that can be send into a payload. 

```js
// Sending JSON
body: JSON.stringify({ username: 'example', password: 'secret' })

// Form data
let formData = new FormData();
formData.append('username', 'example');
body: formData

// Plain text
body: 'This is a text payload'
```

Usually when sending a payload, I should specify the content type property as well `Content-Type': 'application/json` when sending JSON for example. [This]('Content-Type': 'application/json) are the most common content type values based on the format of the payload file. 

>Remember any request has a [[22.5 One-time consumption|one-time consumption]] behavior. 

## Setting headers
Remember some headers are [[22.2 HTTP headers#Forbidden headers|forbidden]], also if the request is secure only, this is `mode: no-cors` [[22.2 HTTP security#Secure HTTP (SHTTP)|certain headers (4)]] are available To add headers, use a 'header' property inside the configuration object or create a Header instance.

```js
const response = await fetch("https://example.org/post", {
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  // ...
});

```

```js
const myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");

const response = await fetch("https://example.org/post", {
  headers: myHeaders,
  // ...
});

```

## Mode option
The `mode` property can also determine if a request is or is not CORS:
- `same-origin`: default mode value. Only allow requests from the same origin. JS has full access to the response. Allow all HTTP methods. 
- `cors`: the request will be CORS, either simple or unsafe/preflighted. 
- `no-cors`: the response `type` property is `opaque` causing JS not be able to read some headers and the response body, and the payload body is `null`. Only safe HTTP methods are allowed. Only secure headers can be send. Useful for download.

Though JS can use the response directly, the browser can do it internally. 

`no-cors` is useful when I need a resource from a server that doesn't send CORS headers (this is why my request should only contain secure headers, the server doesn't know how to answer back). Also check [[22.2 Request and response handling|this note]].

>    .then(function(response) {
>      console.log(response);
>      return response.json();
>    })
>    .then(function(response) {
>      img.src = response.data.images.original.url;
>    });

Can access payload, thus, data can't be manipulated by JS. 


## Credentials
CORS request made by JS methods don't bring any credentials (cookies, authentication headers, TLS headers) from the server. In the case of fetch, it doesn't send cookies with CORS request as a security measure (a request with credentials allow JS to act on behalf of the user), even cookies that belong the requested server are not sent by default. It has three values:

- `omit`: never send credentials
- `include`: only if the server really trust the requester script, always include credentials, even cross-origin.
- `same-origin`: send credentials for same-origin requests.

```js
// now fetch havd the capability to send cookies to another.com with the request to that site
fetch('http://another.com', {
  credentials: "include"
});
```

Include credentials in a request makes the site vulnerable to CSRF attacks, therefore, if the server allows a request with credentials it must include the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header in its response, and specify explicitly the client's origin in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. 

>[!error]
>- Access-Control-Allow-Origin is prohibited from using a star * for requests with credentials. Like shown above, it must provide the exact origin there. Thatâ€™s an additional safety measure, to ensure that the server really knows who it trusts to make such requests.
>- Is the server's work to give the correct `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers. 

```js
// response from the server
200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

## Full example
```js
const myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");

const response = await fetch("https://example.org/post", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ username: "example" }),
  headers: myHeaders,
});

```
