# About module declarations
Module declarations allows to layer types on top of things already exported by a module. After `declare` I can set the scope of that type definition, to follow to the registry pattern, detail the scope is a single module. 

For example, this declaration is affecting a particular module, the `registry` module, by adding an interface `DataTypeRegistry` the type `magazine: Magazine`. This would be the same as copy the interface and paste it into the registry file. 

The problem that is going to be solve here is that, I want to allow the user to use a function with an specific record and its ID, but I don't know the specific types a user will need. Meaning, in registry I can list the types of records inside of fetch record like `function fetchRecord(arg: book | magazine | what else???)`, I need to be able to register automatically the types. 

To achieve that create modules to represent each type, with a module declaration at the end that sends that type to the registry class. 

```ts
// book.ts
export class Book {
  deweyDecimalNumber(): number {
    return 42
  }
}

declare module '../lib/registry' {
  export interface DataTypeRegistry {
    book: Book
  }
}
```

```ts
// magazine.ts
export class Magazine {
  issueNumber(): number {
    return 42
  }
}

declare module '../lib/registry' {
  export interface DataTypeRegistry {
    magazine: Magazine
  }
}
```


Detail its inside of the registry I register all types of classes. and I use an open interface

```ts
//lib/registry.ts

// this is the open interface
export interface DataTypeRegistry {
  // empty by design
}
// the "& string" is just a trick to get
// a nicer tooltip to show you in the next step
export function fetchRecord(
  arg: keyof DataTypeRegistry & string,
  id: string,
) {}
```

The key take is that I have a central interface, registry, that other modules can populate with new interfaces.
