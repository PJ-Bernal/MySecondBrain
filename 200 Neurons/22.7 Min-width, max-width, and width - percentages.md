[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]


## Width
Sets a fix width of an element. When used with `px`, use a fixed width regardless of the parent's container size, `%` sets the width relative to the parent container's width.

## Min-width
It should be at least bigger than this width & I want to take up space the whole space initially. Min-width takes precedence over max-width if they conflict.

## Max-width
It canâ€™t be bigger than this width & I want to take up designated space initially.

## Combine
I can use max and min, along with width.

This element will be 75% of its parent's width, but never narrower than 300px or wider than 800px.

```css
.responsive-box {
  width: 75%;
  min-width: 300px;
  max-width: 800px;
}
```

## Percentages
Percentages are always relative to the parent's container width. One problem arises when using `margin: 0 auto;`, the margin will change dynamically with the size of the element, and the margins should be 'fixed'.
