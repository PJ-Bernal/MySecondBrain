## Object data - Attributes
The data stored within an object (also known as attributes, properties, state, etc. The term depends on the language) represents the state of an object and differentiates between other objects of the same class. Attributes allow the object to work as intended. 

## State of an object
An object state is the current value of all its attributes. 
## Object behavior
Behaviors are represented as methods. Objects can use other object's methods by calling them. 

>[!example]- Calling a method of another object

>The payroll object has a method to calculate the payroll of an employee using the SSN. To get this, the payroll object sends a message to the employee object, requesting the SSN by calling the getSSN( ). Finally, the employee object recognize the message and return the SSN. 

[question:: All methods from a class are accessible to other objects?]

### Getters and setters
Getters and setters are special methods used to get and set the value of an attribute. Thus, it provides control on how the an attribute is read or change. 

In general, each attribute (assumig they all private) should have a setter (not always, as some attributes could be read only) and getter method (accessor and mutator methods) (they support data hiding). Nowadays, setters and getters are considered properties, methods, for each attribute, and must be available for the user only throught the interface (with a hide implementation).

An attribute should be private and then grant access to it. A fully public attrbute should never exist.

[question:: search use cases for private attributes]

[question:: all the attributes should be private?] - https://medium.com/@cesarkohl/public-protected-and-private-properties-in-oop-de03166d23cf prove this with code!

>[!example]- Not all classes have accessor and mutator methods
>![[Pasted image 20240110154220 1.png|center|300]]
>The second class doesn't require any accessor and mutator methods, although it has at least one attribute. This is because it's only purpose is calculate the payroll; meaning not all classes must have those two method types. 

[question:: Should all classes have accesso and mutator methods?]

>[!info]- Method interface, not implementation
>![[23.1 Introduction#^78b1bb]]

To use a method the user must know: the name, parameters and return type. 



>[!info]- Composition
>Objects ease complexity as one object can contain multiple objects (a cellphone contains hundreds of objects. myCar class has an instance of the Engine class), this is known as composition.

## State of an object
Refers to the current value of all object's attributes at certain moment.
