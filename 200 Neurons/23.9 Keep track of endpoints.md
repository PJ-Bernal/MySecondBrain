[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

Is not a good practice to hard code the Routes in the controllers, is better to create a dedicated class in the API directory. 

The Base property, is not mandatory, but is good to have it. Having an APIBase called api is good practice. Then I create the endpoints for the API, creating private fields for the end points, exposing what I need.

Then in the controllers I can delete the `Route` attribute and call the required endpoint via its class.

The og code.
