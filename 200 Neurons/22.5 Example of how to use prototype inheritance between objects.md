To get the object prototype of an object I can use the `Object.getPrototypeOf()`, to modify the object prototype, or better, to make it inherit from other object I can use `Object.setPrototypeOf()`, that says that the prototype of the first argument inherits the prototypes of the second argument. 

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.sayName = function() {
  console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name}!`);
};

function Player(name, marker) {
  this.name = name;
  this.marker = marker;
}

Player.prototype.getMarker = function() {
  console.log(`My marker is '${this.marker}'`);
};

Object.getPrototypeOf(Player.prototype); // returns Object.prototype

// Now make `Player` objects inherit from `Person`
Object.setPrototypeOf(Player.prototype, Person.prototype);
Object.getPrototypeOf(Player.prototype); // returns Person.prototype

const player1 = new Player('steve', 'X');
const player2 = new Player('also steve', 'O');

player1.sayName(); // Hello, I'm steve!
player2.sayName(); // Hello, I'm also steve!

player1.getMarker(); // My marker is 'X'
player2.getMarker(); // My marker is 'O'

```

So the code defines a Person from whom a Player inherits functions, thus, after I set the person prototype to Plater, Player has access to both sayName and getMarker. This is because when using `Object.setPrototypeOf()` what is inherit is the `prototype` property of the OC function and not its `[[Prototype]]`.  

>[!important]
>Though it seems to be an easy way to set up Prototypal Inheritance using Object.setPrototypeOf(), the prototype chain has to be set up using this function before creating any objects. Using setPrototypeOf() after objects have already been created can result in performance issues. So I have to create the objects after altering the prototype inheritance. 

This image shows the chain perfectly, so here the `[[Prototype]]` of player1 is not the `[[Prototype]]: Object` but the `[[Prototype]]` of Person, and the `[[Prototype]]` of person is `[[Prototype]]: Object` of the object Object, and the `[[Prototype]]` of the Object object is null. In this case, getMarker is the prototype of the OC function. 

Also, detail the constructor is not an accessible property perse, is there only to show who build the object. In this case, the player1 object was made using the constructor of Player, and the `[[Prototype]]` of Player1, was made using a constructor. (THIS is a clear hint that mi player1 object is inherit properties from the Person object and not directly from the object Object).

The dotted lines shows what the object is inheriting.

In this case I can say that person is the prototype of player1, or player1 prototypically inherits from person. 

## What happen under the hood of the method
When I use `Object.setPrototypeOf(Player.prototype, Person.prototype);` something happen under the hood:

>[!multi-column]
>
>The property chain:
>%% %%
>The method sets the prototype of `Player.prototype` (the property) to `Person.prototype`, establishing prototype inheritance. This means instances of `Player` will inherit functions from `Person.prototype`. 
>%% %%
>Detail the properties **are not** inherit, so age is not available.

Inheritance of methods: all method defined within `Person.prototype` are available for all instance of Player. 

>[!error]
>Using this method of inheritance is quite different from using [[22.5 call( ) method to copy constructor properties and methods to another CF|the call method]] so remember that. Remember the solution to use both [[22.5 Using Object.setPrototypeOf and call ( )|using the call and set functions]]
