[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]
## Parameters vs arguments
Parameters are defined within `( )` in the function declaration. Arguments are the literals or variables used when is invoked in the main script. 

>For every parameter, PHP requires an argument, other wise an error will appear. 
## Type hinting parameters
>[!multi-column]

>Casting parameters can be done and, as usual the PHP interpreter will try to cast when possible.

>[!multi-column]
>
>When strict type is used, the arguments must be the same type as the parameters.

## Union types

>Since PHP 8 I can have multiple parameter types.

## Default values or non require parameters
>[!multi-column]
>
>In case an argument is not present when the function is called, a default parameter also call non required can be coded. Detail the function is being invoked with only one argument, but the function is still working.

Scalar, array and null (constants expressions in general) values can be used as default. Not a function call, object or another expression.

>>Parameters have an order and this is all the required parameters must be hard coded first, and then the non required ones. In this case I have, required, non required, required; and this is not going to work.

## Arguments by value or reference
Arguments by default are passed by value, or be hard coded to work as reference.

>In this case, variables are passed by reference. Detail after the function called, the variable is no longer `6.0`, but `3`, because the variable was modified within the function. Detail also the result is still 21.

## Variadic functions - splat operator - capture
Variadic functions accept variable number of arguments (one or multiple arguments). To accomplish this, use the splat operator (also called ellipsis or unpacking operator) `...` and then a variable name; thus, **arguments passed will be capture as an array** (I can use array functions now).

>[!important]
>The splat operator can be used after a fixed number of parameters, in which case only those will be added to the array. 
>![[Pasted image 20240308102417.png|center|400]]

>Use the splat operator is not that common.

>[!example]

>Detail here, the array and `2` are converted into an array, creating an associative array. 

### Type hint
>[!multi-column]
>
>In the image above, the splat arguments are getting cast because, though the strict mode is active, there is no coercion specified in the parameter list. But the splat operator can be hint as well.

## Splat operator vs array as parameter
>[!important]
>Arrays can be used as parameters, but they can't be coerced; splat operators can do that. 
## Unpacked array into an argument list with splat
To unpack an array as an argument list, the splat operator must be used when invoking the function. 

>[!multi-column]
>
>![[Pasted image 20240308103111.png]]
>In this case, the array is being passed as an argument, this, an error appear, because the array is not an integer or float. 
>
>![[Pasted image 20240308103339.png]]
>Using the splat operator, each array item is passed as one argument at a time. 

### Spread operation
 >[!important]
 >Since PHP 7.4, the splat operator can be used to unpack arrays within other arrays. This is known as a spread operation.
 
## Named arguments
>[!multi-column]
>
>New for PHP 8, allow to pass arguments based on the parameter variable name and not in order. For example if my function parameters are `($a, $b, $c)`, when invoking the function the first parameter will refer to a, the second to b and the last to c. 
>%% %%
>In this case the arguments are interchange, and the result is not correct (its suppose to be 2), the argument `$y` is getting replace on the function as the parameter `$x`.
>
>%% %%
>%% %%
>![[Pasted image 20240308103858.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>
>Now, I name each argument, to make it explicit what argument refers to what parameter 
>
>![[Pasted image 20240308104249.png]]

>Require parameters can be mixed with name parameters, as long as parameter don't get override. Name overwriting will cause an error.

### Use cases
If for some reason I need to change the parameter order, if the arguments are named, I can do that with no problem. If the arguments are not named, then I'll have to change in every function invocation the order of the parameters manually. 

When a function have parameters with default values, I can name the parameters to change the desired values instead of write all of them. For example, this function has multiple parameters, but I only want to change the first two and the last one, well I need to write all the default parameters manually (there is no way to target only the first two an the last one).

![[Pasted image 20240308104936.png|center|]]

To solve this, I can check the names on the function description (name, value, expires, etc.) and the named the parameters, without passing the default values (0, '', '').

### Array names
Given an array with key/value pairs, when it gets unpack, the keys will be treated as argument names. 

![[Pasted image 20240308105914.png|center]]

Detail when invoking the function, the parameters are passed in wrong order, the first key is y and the second is x, but when var_dump, the function knows which one is x and y, regardless the parameters are inversed. 

If an array value don't have a key, this one will be treat as a positional key, this means, will be the first argument of the function, triggering an error. 

![[Pasted image 20240308110058.png|center]]

In this case, 2 has no key so the function recognized it as the `x` parameter; x is named within the array, name override is happening so an error happens.
