Features of http context are read-only collections. 

This action method uses a feature, the `IHttpConnectionFeature`, to get the required information.

Produces this output.

I can write a test that checks whether the info provided by this feature is effectively the same as what is used in the statistics dto.

# Creating the test
Add a new class to the test project.

Arrange the features values in variables so the test can use assert later. Then mock the i feature collection.

Now, the method I need to set up is a get method, because when getting an I http connection feature from the feature collection, I want to return a new http connection feature that has the ip address values.

Then, I need a context. So I can use the default of a mock. This example use the default.

Then I need to set the features collection on it, however, the deafult http context is a read-only property, detail it only has a get method.

![[Pasted image 20250305110056.png]]

For that reason I need a mock.

![[Pasted image 20250305110119.png]]

Then create a mapper configuration and finally new up the statistics controller.

![[Pasted image 20250305110221.png]]

Now detail the statistic controller is read only.

![[Pasted image 20250305110405.png]]

So I need to set up a controller context.

![[Pasted image 20250305110445.png]]

Then assert and act.
