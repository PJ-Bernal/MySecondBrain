# C# is resilient and safe
## Safety
Safety prevents incorrect output by creating exceptions.

In C++ for example, thus result will cause memory corruption, that could result into an exception (luckily) or pass undetected creating an undefined program behavior.

This program uses a Point, which is a library whose implementation and definition is in a separate binary. 

The application initialize a local variable called `pt`, setting X and Y, and display the result calling the point method `ToString()`.

A common scenario involves a newer version of a library, in this case, adding a third point to the `Point` library. **Only** the library has changed, the app remains the same.

>  {
>    return $"({X}, {Y}), {Z}";
>  }
>}

Once the app runs with the newer version of the library, the app still runs!

This shows resilience! In this specific case, the developer don't have to use o even take care of the new implementation, the app stills runs. 



>[!important] Breaking changes
>When a change in a library or dependency (changing `int` to `string` in the variable declaration of point, for example) can't be guarantee by the application's runtime, an exception will appear.
