[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]
## const
Const values can't change once declared. They are hoisted to the top of their scope which is block scoped, see [[22.5 let - let hoisting#^269057|this example]]. Also:
- A new error occurs when re-init a const, or when no init was made. 
- Const require to be declared and initialized at once, otherwise, an error will happe. 

```js
const PI = 3.142;
PI = 22/7; // Let's reassign the value of PI
console.log(PI); // Output: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

const a;
console.log(a);
// SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
```

```js
let globalAge = 23; // This is a global variable

// This is a function - and hey, a curly brace indicating a block
function printAge (age) {
  var varAge = 34; // This is a function scoped variable

  // This is yet another curly brace, and thus a block
  if (age > 0) {
    // This is a block-scoped variable that exists
    // within its nearest enclosing block, the if's block
    const constAge = age * 2;
    console.log(constAge);
  }

  // ERROR! We tried to access a block scoped variable
  // not within its scope
  console.log(constAge);
}

printAge(globalAge);

// ERROR! We tried to access a function scoped variable
// outside the function it's defined in
console.log(varAge);
```


The same behavior as , the declaration is hoisted but the variable remains inaccessible (until a init happens), no variable default undefined value is init. Same  [[22.5 Temporal dead zone|temporal dead zone]] behavior. 

 ```js
console.log(hoist); // 
const hoist = 'The variable has been hoisted.';
// Uncaught ReferenceError: hoist is not defined
```

```js
const PI;
console.log(PI); // Ouput: SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
PI=3.142;
```
