[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

A function should do exactly what is suggested by its name, no more.

Two independent actions usually deserve two functions, even if they are usually called together (in that case we can make a 3rd function that calls those two).

A few examples of breaking this rule:
- `getAge` – would be bad if it shows an alert with the age (should only get).
- `createForm` – would be bad if it modifies the document, adding a form to it (should only create it and return).
- `checkPermission` – would be bad if it displays the access granted/denied message (should only perform the check and return the result).
