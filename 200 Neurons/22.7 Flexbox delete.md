## Flexbox overview
Flexbox is a toolbox of properties that uses two types of boxes (different from block and inline boxes):
- Flex containers: box that has a `display: flex` ruleset, that groups flex items and define how they're positioned. 
- Flex items: direct child of a flex container, that lives inside of it.  
![[Pasted image 20240205140656.png|center|350]]
>Flex items can be manipulated individually, but for the most part, it’s up to the container to determine their layout.

>[!multi-column]
>
>Now, an insider box can be both a flex container and a flex item. This is, I can use `display: flex` on a flex.

## Flex container

[question:: Regardless the type of container used (div, etc.), when apply `display: flex;` its display property will be flex, neither block nor inline. Is flex but the flex box share some properties with block or inline, right?]
### Using two flex container for one set of flex items
In some cases using two flex containers to wrap a set of flex items is convenient specially when I want to layout freely the internal flex container, not only the items.

### Considerations for flex containers
- Flexbox is affected by the [[22.7 Outer and inner display types - block - inline#The standard box model - `box-sizing content-box`|standard box model]] by default, or the [[22.7 Outer and inner display types - block - inline#Alternate box model - `box-sizing border-box`|alternate box model]] (if the box-sizing property is change); this means, width/height values are fixed, no matter if the content is larger, etc. However, if no height provided, the container's height will be the same as the highest item or container's value. If no width is provided, the container's width, NOT ITS ITEMS, will extend to the viewport; response is active. 

>[!example]- 
>![[Pasted image 20240208121757.png]]
>Height and width values were provided, standard box model active, dimensions fixed. No responsive.
>![[Pasted image 20240208123703.png]]
>No values provided, the container takes the height of the elements and extends horizontally, responsive is given. If I want manage the items within a specific zone of the container, this is when is useful [[22.7 Flexbox delete#Using two flex container for one set of flex items|two flex containers]] for one set of items.  

>[!example]-

- There are only two ways for the items to overlap its container, this is if the `flow-shrink: 0;` or if an item is larger than the container defined width or height. 
- REMEMBER THE OVERFLOWING CONTAINER WHEN I HAVE A CONTAINER INSIDE A CONTAINER.
## Flex items considerations
- They can modify its container's height, if the container don't have a specified height value. Again, taking the higher flex item.

## Distributing multiple flex items
>[!multi-column]

>Flexbox becomes even more strength when the flex container has more than one flex item, in which values like `justify-content: space-around`, that will distribute the flex items across the entire width, but adding space to either side of the elements. `justify-content: space between` will add this space between the elements, thus, the elements get pushed to the border of its container. 
>
![[Pasted image 20240205144316.png|center|350]]

## Grouping elements
Flex containers only know how to position elements that are one level deep (i.e., their child elements). They don’t care one bit about what’s inside their flex items. Grouping is usually done using `div`. 

![[Pasted image 20240205151625.png|center|300]]

>[!warning]
>For stretch, the box for each item extends the full height of the flex container, regardless of how much content it contains.

## Wrapping flex items
The flexbox model allow to render items as a grid, change their alignment, direction, order, and size. To apply this, use `flex-wrap` property. This will wrap the elements to its flex container height and width. Again, the property must be use in the container

![[Pasted image 20240205202436.png|center|350]]
Achieve something like the image above with float-based layouts will be extremely difficult.

>[!warning]

## Flex item order
>[!multi-column]
>
>The `order` property allow flex items to define its order in the flex container without affecting surrounding items. Every item is render in a numeric order, thus, when a order value is given, it will find in the appropriate order.

The default value in 0, and when an order number is given, the element will move to respect the order of all elements. Remember, in the first image, all the order values is zero of all elements; in the second all but the box 1 value are zero, the box 1 was the only changing from 0 to 3. 

>[!warning]
>Unlike setting `row-reverse` and `column-reverse`, that affects only single lines of render rows/columns, not all elements at once. The `order` property works with all elements and affect directly how all elements are render. 
## Flex item alignment
Alignment also works at flex item level. Using `align-self` override any `align-item` value from its container, and will align the element to the start, end, center, etc. of the container. Padding, margin and border works as usual, they don't get override or something. 

Possible values are: center, flex-start, flex-end, etc.

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240207110942.png]]
>Here the subscribe and the links have `align-self: flex-end;`

## Flexible items space distribution
The `flex` property alter the width/height of the elements to fill the available space in the main dimension (principally horizontal direction), telling its container how to distribute extra space to each one of its items; either to growing or shrinking (the last one can prevent overflow). For example, an item with a `flex` value of `2` will grow twice as fast as items with the default value of `1`, like in the image

![[Pasted image 20240206164751.png|center|400]]

>[!warning] General considerations
>- When a flex item don't have any flex properties (grow, shrink or basis), the items won't flex (won't fulfill the free space), and its size will be given by the height and width specified; this is, it will behave like a block box. 
>- When a flex item has any flex properties (basis, grow and/or shrink), they and the width or height are consulted to resolve how to distribute the extra space among the items. If a box is not a flex item (its container hasn't the `display: flex;` property, flex has no effect and its size is given by its width and height.
>- A flex item is fully inflexible (the free space is not going to distribute onto the flex item) if both its flex-grow and flex-shrink values are zero, and flexible otherwise.
>- Its initial value is `0 1 auto`. 
>- `min/max-width` on the other hands still work in the flex item if the `flex` property is present. 
>- `justify-content` distributes the extra space between items. `flex` distribute that space onto the items themselves.

Now, the property `flex` is the shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`; this means `flex: 1;` equates to: `flex-grow: 1`, `flex-shrink: 1`, `flex-basis: 0`.

>[!warning] Note about the flex auto
>![[Pasted image 20240207123234.png|center|450]]
### Flex-basis
The initial main size of the flex item, before free space is distributed according to the flex factors. Using auto, the item will check for its width declaration, if there isn't, it will check the content's width (declared or not), and then shrinks or grow accordingly. Using a % will take into account the width of the container. 

>The grow and the shrink factors are affected both by the basis factor.

>[!warning] Note about flex basis
>![[Pasted image 20240207123300.png|center|450]]

>[!info]
>- The % value represents the width of the item flex value based on the size of the flex container (even if the container has or note a given width value), NOT the flex item width.

>>![[Pasted image 20240207122815.png]]
>>Detail on the box model, the base-size  says flex-basis: 0%, thus, the base size is 0. 
### Flex-grow
>[!multi-column]
>
>Flex-grow determines how much the flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items in the flex container when positive free space is distributed. When omitted, it is set to 1. ; thus, if one of three divs has been assigned with `flex: 2 1 0%;`, that single div will growth 2x the size of the others. 
>
>![[Pasted image 20240207085917.png]]


>[!info] What the grow factor does in real?
>It depends of which widths have been specified:
>- If the flex items don't have a specified width, the grow factor will divide the container width in the total of grow parts, this is, the sum of all grow factors in the elements. For example, if the container width is 100px, I have three flex items each one with a grow of 1, the total factor will be 3, thus, each item will be having a width of 33.33; if one item has a growth factor of 4, then, the total will be 6, and each grow factor unit will have 16.6; therefore, the first and last element width will be 16.6, and the middle one 4 * 16.6 = 66.6.
>![[Pasted image 20240207115203.png]]
>- If the flex items and container have a width, the growth factor is going to take into account BOTH widths, and only the growth factor will be proportional. Is quite complicate to find the real growth number when both widths are specified. 
>>![[Pasted image 20240207121514.png]]
>>
>>![[Pasted image 20240207121523.png]]
>>
>>Detail how the width of the container is defined and respected, and the growth value, the flexibility of the second items is 3 times of the first item. 
>- If the only the flex items have a width, the growth factor will take into consideration only that with. Again the calculations are difficult. But again, if the first element grows 2px, the second will grow 6px. 
>![[Pasted image 20240207122635.png]]


>[!warning]-
>
>- If the container doesn't have a width value, and the elements are set to grow, the container will occupied all the container available; this means, the viewport has responsive, the width of the elements will change dynamically. 
>![[Pasted image 20240207092907.png]]
>![[Pasted image 20240207092932.png]]
>- If the flex container has a specified width and the viewport is less than tat value, there is no responsive, the width of the container is respected, and the flex elements won't change it size, even a shrink value is present. 
>![[Pasted image 20240207093335.png]]
>- If the container has a specified width, both the grow and shrink factor 
### Flex-shrink
Determines how much the flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items in the flex container when negative free space is distributed. When omitted, it is set to 1. The property only gets applied if the size of all flex items is larger than their parent container. If you do _not_ want an item to shrink then you can specify `flex-shrink: 0;`

>The default value of flex-shrink is 1 if not specified. Thus, even the shrink factor don't exists, the element will still shrink. 

>[!example]- No shrink factor with a flex container width set
>![[Pasted image 20240207091120.png]]
>- The size of the container is 250px, but the content overcomes it.
>- The shrink value of all elements is zero, therefore, no matter what, if the viewport changes or the container width is less than all the flex items width; all elements width is respected. 

>[!example]-
>In this example, there is no responsive because the width of the container is fixed. But the elements do shrink. Their initial width was set to 200px, but the factor made then shrink, ended up ay 158.67. 
>![[Pasted image 20240207095415.png]]

>[!example]- Useful to control which elements shrink or not.
>![[Pasted image 20240207095457.png]]
>In this example, there is responsive, of all the container (don't have a width), but the second element is not going to shrink no matter what.

## Flex items and auto-margins
Auto-margins are use to avoid over use of `div`, specially when the div's only use is align items. Auto-margins help to align items to the left/right of a container, they eat up all the extra space in a flex container moving the selected flex item and all the asides elements.
