I have three scopes here. One global with the variables `x = 100` and `y = 200`, another with `y = 10` and another inside of the `innerFunction()`. However, detail the scopes doesn't interfere between each other. 
```js
let x = 100;
let y = 200;

function outerFunction(x) {
    let y = 10;
    return function innerFunction() {
        console.log(x + y);
    };
}

const closure = outerFunction(5);
closure(); // Outputs 15
```
