# About namespaces
Namespaces group classes and other custom types like structs, enums, and much other types. They have [[23.7 Custom types - BCL contains custom types - namespace - global usings#Types in namespaces|several purposes]], like organize custom types in 'directories', to avoid naming collisions, thus, creating multiple classes with the same name. 

To use a custom type from a namespace in a code base, its namespace must be available in the code with the `using` keyword. 
## Fully qualified name
The fully qualified name is the namespace and the custom type name combined, used to identify the custom type; this name must be unique. 

Instead of use `using`, use the fully qualified name. It's not common, but still.

# Creating a namespace

Add the `namespace` keyword followed by its name.

To indicate a sub-namespace, add a dot at the end.  

VS create by default a **root** namespace which is the application name. In this example, the app name is BethanyPieShop, and the .HR makes obvious every customer type there will be related to HR. 

However, not all custom types should be in the root namespace; better to have subfolders.
## Subdirectories for namespaces
Right click on project -> add -> new folder, add a name. VS by default will place this folder within the root namespace, meaning, that folder has its own namespace `<default namespace>.<name of the folder>`, and all classes created within that folder will have that namespace. 

Custom types moved to the folder won't be updated, so add `.<name of the folder>`.

In theory [question:: confirm this], the namespaces within the folder should have the appropriate concatenation with the . 
## File-scoped namespace

Since C# 10, an alternative syntax was introduced, where all custom types within a file will be part of the same namespace. To use this, add a semicolon at the end of the name space, and delete the curly braces

## About the default namespace
Every time a custom type is created with new -> add item -> class (for example), C# will create automatically a file with the given name inside of a default namespace (that's the same name of the project).

Right click on project -> properties -> general tab, there's a default namespace. 

This means, every custom type within the project will be inside of that default namespace (the name can be change if required). 

So, Employee, EmployeeType, and WorkTask, all are inside of that namespace.

However, the entry point, `program.cs` is not, therefore, all used namespaces within the program must be include with `using`.
