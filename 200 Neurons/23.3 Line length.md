[[13.3 Clean code]]

Generally, your code will be easier to read if you manually break lines that are longer than about 80 characters. When manually breaking lines, you should try to break immediately after an operator or comma.

```javascript
// This line is a bit too long
let reallyReallyLongLine = something + somethingElse + anotherThing + howManyTacos + oneMoreReallyLongThing;

// You could format it like this
let reallyReallyLongLine =
  something +
  somethingElse +
  anotherThing +
  howManyTacos +
  oneMoreReallyLongThing;
```
