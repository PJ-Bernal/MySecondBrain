[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

Usually is better to log into a database or file. See the third-party logging providers docs. This note will use the serilog. 

# Add serilog package
Right click project -> manage nuget packages, search serilog.aspnetcore, install. Serilog use sink (a location) to 'store' the log, in this case I want to log to a console and a file, so I need to add those two sinks.
## Adding sinks
Below the IDE is the package manager console, and execute: `install-package serilog.sinks.file`, and `install-package serilog.sinks.console`.  
# Adding the log into program
Configure serilog by setting `Log.logger` to a new logger configuration. Log is define within a serilog namespace, therefore from the `LoggerConfiguration` there's tons of methods to use. 

The image shows the minimum configuration methods. First the minimum log level to debug, then, where to log to, console and file (passing a path and the rolling interval which is how often the logs are created). Finally the logger is create with createLogger. 

In this example, once the application is executed a logs folder will be created with the respective log.

Now tell ASP.NET Core to use serilog instead of the default logger. To do that call builder use serilog, detail no other log methods should be invoked, they are commented.

Using third party loggers don't require to set any additional configuration.
