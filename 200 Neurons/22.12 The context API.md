## Props drilling
API that allows to manage global state of a parent component without passing data through multiple levels of components using props. Context lets the parent component make some information available to any component in the tree below it—no matter how deep—without passing it explicitly through prop (and not from the father to the son, which is father of another object, and then its son, etc.)

Assume a shopping cart, with a counter in the header. This is a sample of a code for this app:

>[!info] How to distinguish prop drilling
>Detail the Header component, the `cartItemsCount` props is **not** being used there, is only a prop whose value is `cartItems.length`. The prop is being use within a component implementation, in this case, is being passed from App, through Header, and inside Header, to Links.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
// other imports for Header and ProductDetail

export default function App() {
  const [cartItems, setCartItems] = useState([
    /* List of Items in Cart */
  ]);
  const products = /* some custom hook that fetches products and returns the fetched products */

  const addToCart = () => {
    // add to cart logic (this adds to cartItems)
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Header cartItemsCount={cartItems.length} />
      <ProductDetail addToCart={addToCart} products={products} />
    </>
  );
}
```

The header component:

```jsx
// import for Link

function Links({ cartItemsCount }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {/* Links */}
      <li>
        <Link to="Link to the cart">
          <span>Cart</span>
          <div className="cart-icon">{cartItemsCount}</div>
        </Link>
      </li>
    </ul>
  );
}

export default function Header({ cartItemsCount }) {
  return (
    <header>
      {/* Other header elements */}
      <nav>
        <Links cartItemsCount={cartItemsCount} />
      </nav>
    </header>
  );
}
```

And the product detail component:

```jsx
export default function ProductDetail({ products, addToCart }) {
  const product = products.find(/* Logic to find the specific product */);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Image of the product */}
      <div>
        {/* elements that align with the design */}
        <button type="button" onClick={() => addToCart(product)}>
          Add to Cart
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

>Here the components are passing data and functions between components. However, detail there is props drilling (`cartItemsCount` pass from app -> head -> links), and there are multiple components the code need to pass some props.

So products and add to cart are passed to the product detail components; and cart items count is passed to header and then to links.

This is a clear example of how complex props ca be when being use in multiple components. 

## Implementing the context API
There are three steps to implement the context API:

1. `createContext`: takes any value that can be referred to as the default value of the context, and returns a context object that can be used to pass down data to the components. This value is static, doesn't change. 
2. `useContext`: hook use to consume data using the context object as a parameter, use it inside of a component. Use the `useContext` immediately not inside loops or conditions.
3. `ContextObject.Provider`: The context object comes with the Provider component that accepts a prop called value, which is the context value that’s going to be passed down to the components no matter how deeply they’re nested.

>[!example]- Image after creating the context
>![[Pasted image 20241224105945.png]]

### Import
Fist import the create context: `import { createContext } from "react";` in the file the context will be created. 

### Create the context
Then create the context with a default value of any data type. In this example, the default value is an object with three properties, two are arrays one is a function that will add items to the cart. 

>[!important]
>- The context object must be exported because other objects will be using this as their own props. 

```ts
// First, define your types
interface Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
}

interface CartItem {
  id: number;
  quantity: number;
}

// Define the context type
interface ShopContextType {
  products: Product[];
  cartItems: CartItem[];
  addToCart: (productId: number) => void;
}

// Create context with a type
export const ShopContext = createContext<ShopContextType>({
  products: [],
  cartItems: [],
  addToCart: () => {},
});
```

#### Creating a null context
Though the context can be null: `const ShopContext = createContext(null);`, having an object is a better choice to prevent the app to crash, and to enable auto-complete of VScode capabilities.

```js
const ShopContext = createContext(null);

// Later, trying to use it without a Provider
function ProductDisplay() {
  const shopData = useContext(ShopContext);
  // shopData is null, so this will crash
  return <div>Price: ${shopData.price}</div>;
}
```

Here the app doesn't crash.

```js
const ShopContext = createContext({
  price: 0,
  currency: 'USD',
  updatePrice: () => {} // Empty function as placeholder
});

// Even without a Provider, this won't crash
function ProductDisplay() {
  const shopData = useContext(ShopContext);
  // shopData.price exists (it's 0) so this works
  return <div>Price: ${shopData.price}</div>;
}
```

### Using the context - create global states - retrieve global states
To manage the global state using the context, use the provider component of the object context where the prop drilling starts, in this case, the App component.

#### Create global states - Provide the context
Identify the parent component and provide the context using the provider component of the context object. 

```jsx
// App.jsx

import { useState, createContext } from "react";
// other imports for Header and ProductDetail

export const ShopContext = createContext({
  products: [],
  cartItems: [],
  addToCart: () => {},
});

export default function App() {
  const [cartItems, setCartItems] = useState([
    /* List of Items in Cart */
  ]);
  const products = /* some custom hook that fetches products and returns the fetched products */

  const addToCart = () => {
    // add to cart logic (this adds to cartItems)
  };

  return (
    /* We are going to pass the things that we want to inject to these components using the value prop */
    /* This value prop will overwrite the default value */
    // No props are passed through App to other components
    <ShopContext.Provider value={{ cartItems, products, addToCart }}>
      <Header />
      <ProductDetail />
    </ShopContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

#### Retrieve global states
Now, import and use the `useContext` hook inside of the component its state is being manage by a provider.

```jsx
// Header
import { useContext } from "react";
// import for ShopContext
// import for Link

function Links() {
  const { cartItems } = useContext(ShopContext); // We must pass the ShopContext object itself as an argument

  return (
    <ul>
      {/* Other links */}
      <li>
        <Link to="Link to the cart">
          <span>Cart</span>
          <div className="cart-icon">{cartItems.length}</div>
        </Link>
      </li>
    </ul>
  );
}

export default function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      {/* Other header elements */}
      <nav>
        <Links />
      </nav>
    </header>
  );
}
```

Up to this point, there is no more prop drilling, because the props are being use directly in the components. Detail `cartItems` is being use directly no matter how deeply nest the component is. 

```jsx
// ProductDetail

import { useContext } from "react";
// import for ShopContext

export default function ProductDetail() {
  const { products, addToCart } = useContext(ShopContext);
  const product = products.find(/* Logic to find the specific product */);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Image of the product */}
      <div>
        {/* elements that align with the design */}
        <button type="button" onClick={() => addToCart(product)}>
          Add to Cart
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

```

>[!important]
>- This implementation don't require to pass any prop from App to other components. 

## Examples
Remember I can always use children when rendering. In this case, any component inside `<Section>` asking for `LevelContext` will have `level` as a value. 

```jsx
import { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js';

export default function Section({ level, children }) {
  return (
    <section className="section">
      <LevelContext.Provider value={level}>
        {children}
      </LevelContext.Provider>
    </section>
  );
}
```
