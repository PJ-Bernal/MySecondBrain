[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

## Selectors
Defines which piece of the document will be selected for styling.
### Universal selector
>[!multi-column]
>
>Represent with `*` will select element of any type. 
>
>```css
>* {
>	color: purple;
>	}
>```

### Type selector
>[!multi-column]
>
>Or element selector, select elements of a given type.
>
>```html
><div>Hi.</div>
><div>Hello world.</div>
>```
>
>```css
>div {
>	color: purple;
>	}
>```
### Class selectors
>[!multi-column]
>
>Select all elements with a given class (HTML attribute)
>
>```html
><p class="Alert-Text">Hi.</p>
>```
>
>```css
>.Alert-Text {
>	color: purple;
>	}
>```

Class selector use the `.` prior to the case-sensitive value of the class attribute. One class can be applied to many elements as I want. 

>[!info] Compound classes
>>[!multi-column]
>>
>>Additionally, multiple clases can be added to a single element, separated with a whitespace. 
>>
>>```html
>><p class="Alert severe-alert">Alert</p>
>>```
>>```css
>>.Alert.severe-alert {
>>	color: purple;
>>	}
>>```
>>To select compound classes, don't left any whitespace, like in this example.
### ID selectors
>[!multi-column]
>
>Select all elements with a given ID (HTML attribute). 
>
>```html
><p id="title">Hi.</p>
><p id="text title"> Hi </p> <!--This is wrong-->
>```
>
>```css
>#title {
>	color: purple;
>	}
>```
>The major difference between classes and IDs is that multiple elements can't have the same ID's, and shouldn't contain any whitespace.

ID selectors use a `#` prior to the case-sensitive value of the ID attribute. 

>[!warning]
>- Classes will suffice. ID use should be use sparingly, as they are used to target elements with JS. So, avoid use ID at all.
>- ID selectors have more specificity than classes, so CSS will target them first.
>

---
>[!error]
>For grouping and chaining selector, don't use any whitespace, after the `,` when grouping, or after the first selector's name when chaining. 

---
### Grouping selector
Group properties of two or more elements to avoid repetition and makes easier to edit both share properties. 

>[!multi-column]
>
>```css
>.read {
>	color: white;
>	background-color: red;
>	/*Several unique properties*/}
>	
>.pay {
>	color: white;
>	background-color: red;
>	/*Several unique properties*/}
>```
>
>```css
>.read, 
>.unread{
>	color: white;
>	background-color: red;
>	}
>	
>.read{
>/*Several unique properties*/
>}
>
>.unread{
>/*Several unique properties*/
>}
>```

>Detail here I'm calling two different classes. 
### Chaining/targeting compound selectors
I can chain selectors as a list. Detail no space is used in the CSS ruleset.  

```html
<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
</div>
```

Two elements have one common class value, but if I want to apply a CSS style to the first one, a chaining is needed.

```css
.subsection.header { /*All the elements that have those classes are target*/
  color: red;
}
```

>Detail here I'm calling one single class. 

The above CSS snippet search for any HTML that has both class values, `subsection` and `header`. 

>[!warning]
>- No whitespace when chaining CSS styles.
>- Chaining works with any selector, except for chaining more than one type selector. For example, chaining `div` with `p`, the selector will try to find a literal `<divp>` element, that doesn't exists.

Chaining also work to chain classes, IDs, types, etc. 

```html
<div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection" id="preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.
  </p>
```

>[!multi-column]
>
>```css
>.subsection.header {
>  color: red;
>}
>```
>
>```css
>.subsection#preview {
>  color: blue;
>}
>```
### Descendant combinator
Only elements that match the selector's path will be affected; this is, the relation grandparent, parent, child, etc. Must be respected. A child will only by selected if it's nested inside ancestor, regardless of how deep that nesting is. 

Detail I used a space for descendant selectors. 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240130210403.png|center|450]]
>In this example, only the element 'B' and 'C' will be selected. (contents that are within ancestor).

>[!warning]
There is no limit in the descendant combinator, `.grandgrandfather .grandfather .father .child `, but this deep of nest is not recommended.

[question:: How many selectors are, search all the type and use cases]
[question:: What are the four types of combinators, descendant is one]
[question:: regardless of how deep that nesting is.]
[question:: Search all ways to select HTML elements, like, wtf is div.class-text, is a type class selector]
