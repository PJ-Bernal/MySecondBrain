SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, where an image is defined by vectors, as opposed to the traditional "raster graphics" where the image is defined by a grid of pixels and its quality is limited to the size of that grid; so, scaling an image require increasing the size of the grid and its file size. 

Vector graphics don't use a grid but formulas for different shapes and lines. Relying on formulas don't affect the quality or size of the image when scaling.
