 Static properties cannot be directly accessed on instances of the class. Instead, they're accessed on the class itself. Static field initializers and static initialization blocks are evaluated one-by-one. Field initializers can refer to field values above it, but not below it. 

>[!important] Why to use static properties or methods
>- Static methods are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects, whereas static properties are useful for caches, fixed-configuration, or any other data you don't need to be replicated across instances.
>- Public static fields are useful when you want a field to exist only once per class, not on every class instance you create.
>- Static properties can't be on the `prototype` of the class. 
>- Think of static properties and methods like what the class can do by itself, and not what its objects can do. 

 ```js
class Triple {
  static customName;
  static description = "I triple any number you provide";
  static calculate(n = 1) {
    return n * 3;
  }
}

console.log(Triple.customName); // undefined
console.log(Triple.description); // 'I triple any number you provide'
console.log(Triple.calculate()); // 3
console.log(Triple.calculate(6)); // 18

const tp = new Triple();
console.log(tp.calculate()); // 'tp.calculate is not a function'
```

I can call static methods from within the class with `this`.

```js
class StaticMethodCall {
  static staticProperty = "static property";
  static staticMethod() {
    return `Static method and ${this.staticProperty} has been called`;
  }
  static anotherStaticMethod() {
    return `${this.staticMethod()} from another static method`;
  }
}
StaticMethodCall.staticMethod();
// 'Static method and static property has been called'

StaticMethodCall.anotherStaticMethod();
// 'Static method and static property has been called from another static method'
```
