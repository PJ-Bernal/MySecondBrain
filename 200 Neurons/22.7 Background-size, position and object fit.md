[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

The `background-size` and `object-fit` work on elements with a background image (and not regular `img` tags), to prevent any change in both height and width. 

## Object-fit
Object fits works the same but is meant to be use with `img` tags. sets how the content of a replaced element, such as an <img> or `video`, should be resized to fit its containerIts default value is fill that will stretch the image to fit some desired dimensions. 

```css
img {
  height: 300px;
  width: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

## Background size
Sets the size of the element's background image. Its values are: cover, contain, `width`, or `width height`. 

`background-size: center` will make sure the image is always center in its container, even if the container is to small to fit the whole image. `background-size: cover` will resize the image so that it is always completely filling its container while cropping as little as possible.

## Background-position
Sets the initial position for each background image.
