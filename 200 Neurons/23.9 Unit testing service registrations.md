 I can check whether a service is actually registered on the Service Collection.

# Creating the test
Having some business services. I can test any method.

Detail this class is an extension class of type service.

The test will test register data services. Start by creating an instance of a service collection. Then I can register the service. But detail the parameter is of type I configuration, because the connections tring is access from it.

I can mock that or create an in memory-instance. This example shows the second.

The key of the connection string matter, but not the value, it could be anything but null or empty. It doesn't matter because the db connection is not being open.
