[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Use to iterate through a collection of information like arrays, range, or hash. `i` is a variable and `in` is a reserved word. Detail `do` is very optional.

```ruby
for i in 0..5 #do
  puts "#{i} zombies incoming!"
end
```

I can't assign `i` any expression or literal, and that variable is loop scope. Also, every iteration will **automatically** add 1 to `i`.

## For is not implemented as a method
Its implemented as a [[22.4 Control expressions|control expression]], a for loop does not have its own scope -- the entire body of the loop, including the loop variable, is in the same scope as the code that contains the for loop, and it can be used.

```ruby
irb> [1,2,3].each { |x| }
  => [1, 2, 3]
irb> x
NameError: undefined local variable or method `x' for main:Object
    from (irb):2
    from :0
```

```ruby
irb> for x in [1,2,3]; end
  => [1, 2, 3]
irb> x
  => 3
```
