[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

## Logical operators
Allow to combine multiple condition together. Operators can be of any data type. 

![[Pasted image 20240305150144.png|center|450]]

The assignment operator has higher precedence than `and, or, xor`. This is why the following code returns true. **be careful** when using this.

```PHP
$x = true;
$y = false;
$z = $x and $y;
var_dump($z);// boolean(true)
```

In this example, the assignation happens `$z = $x` and the rest `and $y` is discarted.
