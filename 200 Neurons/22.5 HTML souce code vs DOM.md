[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

There are two instances in which the browser-generated DOM will be different than HTML source code:
- The DOM is modified by client-side JavaScript.
- The browser automatically fixes errors in the source code (for example, forget to include the `tbody` tag within a table, or miss an obvious indentation).

>In this case, when the browser parses the source code, it automatically indents the HTML tags to make it readable. However, detail the source code from the page and the editor is the same.

The source of a website will not change and will never be affected by client-side JavaScript. How ever, the browser parser will read any of the DOM changes first.
