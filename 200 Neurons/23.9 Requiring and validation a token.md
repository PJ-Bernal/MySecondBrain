[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

# Install the package
The Bearer token authentication schema is used to send a token to the API on each request. A middleware can be used to validate the incoming token, the JwtBearer middleware. Install the microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.

REMEMBER THIS NOTES ARE NOT USING A USER NAME AND PASSWORD FROM A DB, SO WHEN CREATING THE TOKEN I ASSUMED IS VALID. 

# Configuring the middleware of the service
Use the add authentication collection to register authentication related services on the container. Then use the add jwt bearer to register services relaed to bearer token authentication (that's the middleware to configure).

## Validation control
Use the `Validate` property to control which aspects of the JWT are validated during the authentication process, in this example, the issuer, audience and the issuer signing key are validated.

`ValidIssuer` property that specifies the expected issuer of the token, in this example, the api is going to accept tokens created by the api. When the token is validated, the iss claim in the token must match the value of ValidIssuer. The same happens with `ValidateAudience`

>In this notes example, the value is obtain from the configuration file, but remember, this is only for development because the secret is on the app settings, but for production this code must change, for azure, aws, etc. Each platform provides ask to grab securely this information and use it in the code. 

# Add the middleware to the request pipeline

# Allow authentication features in the controller
Add the authorized attribute for all controllers.

But don't add the attribute for the authentication controller as that controller must remain accessible for unauthenticated users that want to authenticate. 

# Testing
Getting the cities don't work any longer, 401. This means the token is working.

![[Pasted image 20250128100836.png]]

Get a token like [[23.9 Creating a token#Testing|here]], then copy it, then clikc authorization and change the type to bearer token and pst the token. 

![[Pasted image 20250128101003.png]]

Then send again and it should be working.

>Using bearer token authorization add a new header on the request with the bearar and the token

![[Pasted image 20250128101111.png]] 

>[!important]
>Detail the header is added because of postman added automatically when chaning the authorization to bearer token. But is the consumer of the api, my react app, to include an authorization header with value Bearer and the token is added on each outgoing request to the api.
