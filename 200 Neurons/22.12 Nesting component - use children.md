[[12.12 React|React]]

Sometimes I want to nest components like HTML.

```jsx
<div>
  <img />
</div>
}
// I want to do something like this
<Card>
  <Avatar />
</Card>
```

In this case, the parent container will receive all the wrap content in a prop called `children` (the content between the opening and closing tags of a component). The father container doesn't need to know what's being rendered inside of it.

ou can think of a component with a children prop as having a “hole” that can be “filled in” by its parent components with arbitrary JSX.





```jsx
import Avatar from './Avatar.js';

function Card({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Avatar
        size={100}
        person={{ 
          name: 'Katsuko Saruhashi',
          imageId: 'YfeOqp2'
        }}
      />
    </Card>
  );
}
```

The following example shows a basic usage, how to manipulate children and how to use a props.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// A simple wrapper component that uses children
const Wrapper = ({ children }) => {
  return <div className="wrapper">{children}</div>;
};

// A component that manipulates its children
const DoubleChildren = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {children}
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

// A component that expects specific children
const Dialog = ({ title, children }) => {
  return (
    <div className="dialog">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <div className="dialog-content">{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

// Example usage
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Wrapper>
        <p>This is wrapped content.</p>
      </Wrapper>

      <DoubleChildren>
        <span>Hello</span>
      </DoubleChildren>

      <Dialog title="Welcome">
        <p>This is the dialog content.</p>
        <button>Close</button>
      </Dialog>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
