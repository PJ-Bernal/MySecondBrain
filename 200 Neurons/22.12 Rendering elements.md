[[12.12 React|React]]

Remember the render method only renders a single element, it needs a single argument. Thus, I need to use a wrapper `React.Fragment`. This doesn't even compile.

Now, because I'm not importing `React` but a specific module, I can't use `React.` methods, in this case, to use `React.Fragment` there's two ways, import Fragment or use the shorthand `<>`

```jsx
// 1st solution
import { StrictMode, Fragment } from 'react'

// 2 solution
import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx'
import './index.css'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <>
    <button>Hola mundo</button>
    <button>Hola mundo</button>
  </>
)
```

## Problem
Everything inside of the element must be a valid JS syntax, thus, when embedding an svg for example, some attributes are hyphen case.

Now what if I want to have ten buttons, the code is not DRY and is a mess, to solve this, create a component.
