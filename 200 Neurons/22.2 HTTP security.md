## Secure HTTP (SHTTP)
To prevent a hacker deploy some packet sniffing techniques the requests/responses strings; or to steal the season id, secure http encrypt every request/response before being transported on the network.

The encryption uses a encryption protocol call `TLS`, and earlier versions of HTTP used `SSL` (Secure Sockets Layer). Those protocols use certificates to communicate with remote servers and exchange security keys before data encryption happens.

Webpages with secure HTTP (or SHTTP) use the `https` scheme with a lock icon.

## Same-origin policy
Same-origin policy only permits unrestricted interaction between resources of the same origin, but restricts certain HTTP requests of different origins(typically resources being access using APIs such fetch).

Same-origin policy doesn't restrict all cross-origin requests. Requests like: linking, redirects, form submissions or embedding resources like scripts, css stylesheets, images and other media, fonts and iframes, are typically allowed. 
### What is an origin
Combination of protocol (http/https), domain, and port.

![[Pasted image 20231107172902 1.png|center|450]]

## CORS
Cross-origin Resource Sharing is a security mechanism implemented by browsers (not the server) to control who can access their resources (APIs for example) from a different domain the one is serving the webpage. They are requests send to another domain (even a subdomain), protocol or port, adding special HTTP headers that allow servers to serve resources.

Though CORS were forbidden, not they are allowed with new capabilities requiring explicit allowance by the server, expressed by this special headers. I can have CORS simple/safe or unsafe request. 

### Safe requests
Also called simple requests, must satisfy two conditions:
1. Don't trigger a preflight and must use [[22.2 HTTP request methods#What is an HTTP method?|safe methods]] (GET, HEAD and POST).
2. Only use safe request headers: 
	- `Content-Type`: with the value `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain`.
	- `Accept`.
	- `Accept-Language`.
	- `Content-Langauge`.

For example a request with a `PUT` method or with an `API-key` HTTP-Header is unsafe. Safe request are made using a form or script without any special methods. 

For CORS safe requests the browser will always add the `Origin` header, containing the origin, without the path. In this example, I'm requesting `https://anywhere.com/request` from `https://javascript.info/page`. 

```
GET /request
Host: anywhere.com
Origin: https://javascript.info
...
```
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20240919115245.png|400]]

Then the server (anywhere) inspects he origin, and if it agrees to accept the request, it add a special header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the response, containing either the origin (`https://javascript.info`) or `*`. If not, then the request fails.

The browser grants the correct origin is sent into the request, and check if the access control allow origin is present, if valid, then JS is allow to access the response.

This is what a successful respond may look like:

```
200 OK
Content-Type:text/html; charset=UTF-8
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info
```

#### Safe response headers
By default, JS may only access so-called 'safe' response headers: Cache-Control, Content-Language, Content-Length, Content-Type, Expires, Last-Modified, Pragma.

JS can access other response headers including the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response header, containing the list of unsafe headers.

```
200 OK
Content-Type:text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 12345
Content-Encoding: gzip
API-Key: 2c9de507f2c54aa1
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Encoding,API-Key
```
### Unsafe requests
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20240919132405.png|300]]

Also called preflight request, don't meet the two safe request conditions. The following is the process of an unsafe request.

[[22.5 fetch and CORS making an unsafe request|This]] example shows the process step by step.
 





#### Preflight
For certain request (like POST with JSON), the browser first send a preflight request to the server asking if it's ok to send the actual request. This request uses the `OPTIONS` method, has no body and three headers: `Access-Control-Request-Method` (contains the unsafe method), `Access-Control-Request-Headers` (contains the unsafe headers), `Origin` (who's making the request, javascript.info).

This request is invisible for JS. It only gets either the response or an error. 

#### 200 ok
If the server agrees, it should respond with empty body, status 200 and headers; `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (must be either `*` or the origins that can access the resource; javascript.info in this case), `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` (must have the allowed method, like POST, PATCH, etc.), `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` (must have list of headers), `Access-Control-Max-Age` (number of seconds the preflight permissions are cached for the given time so subsequent requests will not cause a preflight).

#### Main HTTP-request and response
Contains the origin and the request, and response headers.

## Session Hijacking
When a hacker posses the session id of a client. Here are some countermeasures.

>[!tip] Resetting sessions
>When a successful login must render and old session id invalid to create a new one causing the client to authenticate, changing the session id. Most websites implement this when changing sensitive information.

>[!tip] setting expiration time

>[!tip] Using HTTPS

## Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
When the client is allow to write HTML or JS that is displaying directly on the website via HTML form. 

![[Pasted image 20231107175818 1.png|center|400]]

The server must sanitize the client input, otherwise the browser will interpret the HTML and JS and execute it. 

Here are some countermeasures.

>[!tip] Input sanitizing
>Eliminate specific input like `<script>` tags and disallowing all HTML and JS input

>[!tip] Escaping input data
>Escaping means replace an HTML character with a combination of ASCII characters (call entities), for example, `<` will be `&#60;` This will be all plain text and not HTML or JS.
