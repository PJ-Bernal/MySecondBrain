Arrange, act and assert is a pattern for writing unit test that divide the test in three sections:
- Arrange: set the test, where object are initialize, calling mocks, etc. 
- Act: where the actual test happens. This involves executing the method I want to test; or set certain property that affect other, etc. Usually, variables set in the arrange section are used here. 
- Assert: verify the test.
