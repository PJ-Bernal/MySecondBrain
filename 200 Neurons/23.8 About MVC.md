# About MVC
ASP.NET Core is a layer base for ASP.NET Core MVC; the MVC allow to create web APIs and web apps.


Typically the classes in the model represents everything the user will work with (pie class, order class) even classes that allow interaction with the database (repositories). 
## Controllers
Provide logic that works on the model and provide data for the view to display. Controllers have action methods. Image a controller as the manager in the MVC pattern, it use the model and view, to create a response that will send back to the client. 

Is responsible for user interaction, for example, when clicking a button the request is send to a server ad pick by the controller. 

The controller creates the response base on user interaction, it will update the model in response to user interaction, and will select which view to be used to represent the model data.  

The controller doesn't need to know how the actual data persistence works (the model hide that from the controller) 
## View
Contain logic that displays data to the user that can be process by a controller action. It can be considered a template, markup use to visualize the data. In ASP.NET Core the view templates are cshtml files. 

Views use razor which allows to write C# in web pages, to generate the server-side rendering. So, html and C# code is mixed, but the C# logic should not be there. 

Each view is represented by a cshtml file. Also views will receive data through the controller, that help me to create the visualization.

The request arrives to one of the controller classes that usually have action methods, public methods, that get associated with a URL. This means, when the user navigates to an specific URL, a specific method on the controller will be invoked. 

After that, some code will trigger on the model and a view will be selected to be displayed with the data, from the model, to the user. 

Views in ASP.NET Core use razor, which is the view engine.
