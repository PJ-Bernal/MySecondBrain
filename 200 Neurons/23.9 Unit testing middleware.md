Only custom middleware must be unit tested. 
# Creating the test
This is the custom middleware, it adds secure headers to the response. The test will check if the headers are added.

Create a class. Detailing the middleware implementation, there are two dependencies, `HttpContext` and a `RequestDelegate`. This last one is called at the end of the invoke async method and moves `await _next(context)` to the next piece of middleware.

This is not isolated, so I need the request delegate be an cation that returns a completed task.
