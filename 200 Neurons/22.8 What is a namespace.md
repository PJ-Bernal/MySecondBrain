## What is a name space?

## When to use namespaces

>[!important]
When defining a function, constant or a class without a namespace definition, by default they will be put in a global space. Once it has a name space, I can't `require` it because that file will be on that specific namespace, on that specific folder.

When using the `Transaction` class in the main script,, PHP will try to locate the 'Transaction.php' file in the global space. In this case it finds it there and therefore everything works.

How ever, this could trigger name collision when multiple classes have the same name, like in the image, in two folders I have the same file. Or I have to import multiple classes.

As an example, this error happens because I'm requesting two classes that have the same name and don't have any namespace.  Even if they are in different directories. Also, both are in the global space.

## Bad practice
Having multiple namespaces in the same file is not recommended.
