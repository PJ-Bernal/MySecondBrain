[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

npm scripts are written in the [[22.5 package.json|package.json]] file adding the `scripts` object property in the form of `"name": "command`. To run script execute `npm run <script name>`. For example, `npm run build` is the same as `npx webpack`, `npm run dev` = `npx webpack serve`

```json
{
  // ... other package.json stuff
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack", //command for bundling, building, compiling
    "dev": "webpack serve",
    "deploy": "git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages"
  },
  // ... other package.json stuff
}
```

>>- `npx` use to execute commands in the terminal.
>
>>- `npm` use to run script from the terminal.  

To output all the scripts/commands the package contains execute `npm run`. 
## Common front-end scripts
```json
{
  // ... other package.json stuff
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node inde.js", //launches the server or app
    "test": "jest", // or "mocha"
    "build": "webpack",
    "dev": "webpack serve", // or "nodemon",
    "lint": "eslint"
    "deploy": "git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages"
  },
  // ... other package.json stuff
}
```

## Webpack life cycle vs npm life cycle
npm runs the scripts define within the `package.json` file, this scripts are **not** specific to webapck. Its life cycle is describe [[22.5 Pre and post script|here]].

Webpack life cycle is completely separate from npm scripts, it has 10 steps.

At each step webpack provides hooks that webpack plugins can use to inject some behavior. 

### When npm and webpack intersects
When a npm script run something about webpack:
1. npm search for any `pre<script>` to run if exists.
2. Then runs `<script>`.
3. Webpack goes over its own lifecycle, triggering any hooks.
4. After webpack finishes, npm will run any `post<script>` if exists. 

```js
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
  }
}
```
