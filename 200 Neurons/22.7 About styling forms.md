[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

## Default browser settings
The user-agent stylesheet of all browser is different, thus, I will have to overwrite it to be able to style myself.

To style mor easily, I can wrap the form components in divs, so, each label/input elements could be in one div. 

### Fonts and text
This code snippet allow the form to have the same size and family.

```css
button,
input,
select,
textarea {
  font-family: inherit;
  font-size: 100%;
}
```

### Box-sizing
>[!important]
>
>Each input has its own rules for border, padding and margin. So, to give all the controls the same size I have to use `box-sizing: border-box;`.

```css
input,
textarea,
select,
button {
  width: 150px;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Legend placement
I have to use the position ruleset, thus, the legend can rely on its field set position property.

```css
fieldset {
  position: relative;
}
legend {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
}
```

### :focus
Handy when the user is focusing an input or textarea. 

### :valid :invalid
Here invalid depends on the `:required` attribute. If exists on the input, and no value has been added, then is an `:invalid` element.  

### :placeholder-show
Allow me to style the place holder input. Different from `::placeholder` that allow me to style the text of the place holder.

## Styling text-based forms vs the rest
Text-based forms like text, email, passwords and text areas operate like any other HTML element and most CSS properties can be used.

However, is a bit more tricky to style radio buttons and checkboxes. To do this check [this article](https://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-checkbox-style/) and search for new CSS properties like [accent-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/accent-color). 

Calendars or date pickers are almost impossible to style with plan CSS. To style them I have to use JS.
