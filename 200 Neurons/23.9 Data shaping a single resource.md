Create another extension method that return a single object, instead of  `IEnum<object>`. Create a new class in helpers.

This is a `ShapeData<TSource>` on some type TSource, which returns an expando object. 

All public properties are not included into a list of objects, in this method for a single resource,

# Why two extension methods
To improve performance. When implement shape data extension method on `IEnumearable<TSource>`, reflection is expensive. 

The shape data method in `IEnumeerable<TSource>`, the method saves a list of property info objects.

Then, the method reuse those property infos for each object in the list. So I have additional reflection for each object. 

# Using the method
The og code.

In the signature theres no need for the author parameter class, just the fields.

# Testing
A single author is returning name and id.

# Violating the manipulation of resources constraint
The sub constraint representations is beign violated because when the consumer holds a representation of a resource it should have enough information to modify or delete the resource, but the id and name is not enough, he needs the URI. 

# Testing error
First name is not a field in the author resource, 500 is bad, should be 400.
