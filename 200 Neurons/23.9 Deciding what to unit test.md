[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

Deciding that to unit test is driven by my project architecture, for example, I can have some layers with only business logic, or I can have some logic within entities, etc. This means, don't blindly follow a convention that states something like repos, entities, constructors, should or shouldn't be tested. Just, focus on test the behavior of my code.

This doesn't mean I need to test all my code. Around 80% of a code coverage percentage is acceptable.
