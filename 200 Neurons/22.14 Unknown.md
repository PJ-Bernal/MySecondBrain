[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

Contrary to any, unknown represents a value that could be anything. It doesnâ€™t turn off type checking like any, and helps dealing with data of uncertain types. However, an asserting is required first to let TS know what the type is.

TS is aware the variable has a type, but it doesn't know which one, therefore, TS don't allow the variable to use "defined type" variable method like to lower case. Once my code tell TS which type is the variable, TS allow to use that specific method.

Unknown is a safer choice than any as enforces the code to do some type checking at least. 

## When to use unknown
- Use with external API responses when the structure might be unknown.
- User inputs when the data is not predetermined.
- Generally, migrate all anys to unknowns
