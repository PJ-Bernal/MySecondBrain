[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

The idea is to create two scopes on the `:root` selector, one for light another for dark. Check [this code pen](https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/PojVRMb) for the implementation of this.

## Let the user defined the theme by its OS
This can be accomplished using the media query `prefers-color-scheme`. Detail the [code pen](https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/powGZzE) that I declare a custom base property that acts as a default theme in case a used doesn't have a preference on their OS. 

Using this media query is useful since it doesn't require to manually change the theme; however, you need to be aware of a few things when it comes to using this media query:

- Only dark and light are valid values for the media query, so you can’t use it to implement any themes beyond these two basic ones.
- The light value for the media query is actually for when a user has a light theme specified or when they have no preference set.
- It doesn’t allow users to change the theme themselves, which can still be important in cases where a user might want to use the theme opposite of their OS/user agent preferred one for whatever reason.
