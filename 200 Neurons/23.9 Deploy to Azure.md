Right click project -> publish. Azure ->  Azure app service windows.

This window appears if I'm sign in in Azure. Create new.

>[!important] About resource group
>For a real deployment is recommended to create a resource group for my app and link the Azure resources that I need for the app under that resource group. 

This image is AN EXAMPLE; search more before this part.

Then next -> and see this window, this is not configured in the image, again, search more information.

Finally.

## Adding the db
The app has some information in a db. This is a sqlite db named CityInfo.db. This file is not copied over when publishing, to ensure that, right click -> properties and change the first two.

In real life is better to switch to a more robust db like sqlAzure. 

## Enable swagger docs regardless of the environment
For that comment the if in the program.

Save the file, and the clikc on publish.

After that automatically the browser opens

Detail there's an error. The way the app is configure don't allow to see the stack trace to search for the problem. A bad solution could be allow the stack even in production, like in the image, but this is a bad practice. Is better to configure azure login and look at the log.
