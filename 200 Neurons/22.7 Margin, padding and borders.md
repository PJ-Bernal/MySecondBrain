## Margin, padding and borders
### Padding
Distance between the content box and the border of an element. Use to push the content box away from the border (to add "background"), but don't move the box. It can't have a negative value. Any background applied to your element will display behind the padding. Also, it has four unique properties to control the top, bottom, right and left padding. 

I can use [[22.7 max ( )|max ( )]] to set a minimum padding size. [This](https://web.dev/articles/min-max-clamp#padding) example shows how to let an element have always certain padding. 
### Border
Drawn between the margin and padding of the box. In the standard box model, it gets added to the width and height of the content box; in the alternate, then the bigger the border is, the smaller the content box is, as the border takes up some of that available `width` and `height` of the element box.

Each four borders (top, right, left, bottom) have a property for style, width and color (for example, `border-top-width`, `border-left-style`, `border-bottom-color`).
### Margin
>[!multi-column]

>Margin is the whitespace around a box use to push other elements from the current box. Is what actually moves the box from its environment.
>%% %% 
>Margins can have positive (push other boxes), negative (pull other boxes to the main box, or pull the box itself in a direction ) values, or auto.

When the elements are `inline`, the margins don't overlap but combine.

The four margins of an elements are controlled by: `margin-top`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`, `margin-rigth`.

#### Center elements with `margin: 0 auto`
Auto will assign the margin automatically; in most cases its value will be 0 or whatever space is available for that box. Therefore, a **block** element with a width value of auto will center the element.

>[!info]- But why doesn't it center vertically?
>Auto only works with block boxes, and they always stack vertically, it's margins collapse. Now, horizontally speaking, the block box will always occupied all the horizontal space, regardless if its being fill by the box. Therefore, centering can be done horizontally, but not vertically.

>[!warning]
>The above behavior change if the block has a position of relative, or a display of flex, etc.
#### Margin collapsing
In general:
- Two positive margins will combine to become one margin. Its size will be equal to the largest individual margin.
- Two negative margins will collapse and the smallest (furthest from zero) value will be used.
- If one margin is negative, its value will be _subtracted_ from the total.

>>>The box with a higher margin will overcome other margin only if the box has a display of `block`. Detail the margin of both elements is 60px, but the distance between them is the same as the first box to the upper border of the viewport. So the margin between the elements is 60px, not 120px. The largest margin overlaps the lower one.

>The p box is nested within the div box, thus, the div is greater and the margin between the header and the paragraph is 40px.
