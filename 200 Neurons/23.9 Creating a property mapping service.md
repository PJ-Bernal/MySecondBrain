One resource property might map to multiple properties on the entity. For example, Name of the Dto, maps to FirstName and LastName on the entity. 

To make this mapping reusable create a generic property mapping service and register in the DI container. 

First, i need the property mapping service class, that implements an interface that allows to register the service in the DI container. That property service has multiple mapping properties, like, one that maps the properties.

# Creating the property mapping service
Add the class to the service folder.

The property mappings should contain a dictionary of strings and property mapping values. So, add a property mapping value class.

This class contains an IEnum string of destination properties one resource property will map to. And a revert boolean, for mapping the dob to age.

Then, inside of the mapping service class, add the mappings are going to be use from the author dto to author, for that, add a dictionary.

Then add a method to add one property mapping, the `<TSource, TDestination>` allows to ask for a mapping from a source to a destination, like from a dto to an entity.

This is a custom type, so create a class for that type. Create this as a generic class defining the type parameters in the signature of the class, then add one property which is a mapping dictionary of type string property mapping value.

Now, in the mapping service class, add a property mapping field. However, detail T source and destination can't be resolve.

To solve this use a marker interface, which is an interface without any methods. Allowing the property mapping class implement that interface, then I can register a list of that marker interface. So add an interface for property mapping in services.

![[Pasted image 20250206095131.png]]

Let the property mapping class implement that interface.

Then, inside of the property mapping service class, register a list of I property mapping. 

![[Pasted image 20250206095413.png]]

Then add its constructor, and then, add the property mapping to that list as a mapping from author dto and author entity.

Then implement the get property mapping method. First, use the of type method passing the property I want to map, in thsi case, property mapping. Then if I find exactly one, return the dictionary with mappings. if not, throw.

![[Pasted image 20250206095600.png]]

Abstract the class as an interface, right click on class name, quick actions and refactorings,  extract interface. 

This will create an interface file with the get property mapping interface.

Finally register in the DI container under start up helper class.
