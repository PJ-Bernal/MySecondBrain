[[13.1 OO Programming|OOP]]

Multiple objects can be instantiated from a single class. Each of these objects has a unique identity and state.  Each object is constructed separately and is allocated its own separate memory, however, some attributes and methods may be shared by all the objects instantiated from the same class. [question: thus sharing the memory allocated for these class attributes and methods. I don't get this part].

Methods represent the behaviors of an object; the state of the object is represented by attributes.

Attributes and methods exist within a particular scope. In Java, the scope is delineated by `{}`. Within the number class, the class itself has its own scope, each instance has its scope, as both methods do. 

>A method, like an attribute, can be declared static to indicate that there is only one copy of the method for the entire clas
## Types of attributes
### Local attributes
Owned by a specific method. `count` is a local variable only accessible for method 1. 

```Java
public class Number {
    public method 1() {
    int count; }
    public method 2(){
    int count; 
    }}
```

>[!info]
>When a method is call, a copy of the local variable is created, Now, when both methods are called, the compiler can tell which copy of copy to access by recognizing its method. For the compiler, there are two different total attributes even though they have the same name, by recognizing the methods, something like this: `method1.count; method2.count;`
### Object attributes
[question:: the private, public or static keywords within the attributes of an class "ARE NOT" required, its for encapsulation, but the class will work without those, conform this. ]

In many cases, an attribute must be shared by several methods within the same object. Object attributes are available for all methods within the class. 

```Java
public class Number {
    int count; //available to both method1 and method 2
    public method1() {
        count = 1;}
    public method2(){
        count = 2;}
}
```

>The attribute `count` has been declared outside the scope of the methods, but within the scope of the class; thus, it's available for both methods. Notice that the code for both methods is setting count to a specific value. There is only one copy of count for the entire object, so both assignments operate on the same copy in memory. However, this copy of count is not shared between different objects

Each object is constructed separately and is allocated its own resources; thus, there are three separate instances of the integer count. If object 1 changes its own attribute, it doesn't affect the other objects. 

```Java
public class Number{
	int count; //object variable 
	public method1() {
		int count;} // Local variable
	public method2(){
		int count;} // Local variable
}
```

Here are three separate memory locations under the same `count`. The object owns one copy and each method has its own copy. To access the object variable from within a method, use the `this` (think this word as a reference to the current object, this is an actual pointer) keyword:
```Java
public method1() {
	int count; 
	this.count = 1; //Accessing object variable within a method
}
```

Using the `this` keyword directs the compiler to access the object variable and not the local variables within the method code. 
### Class attributes
When objects share the same attributes, Java can make the attribute `static`

```Java
public class Number {
	static int count;
	public method1() {
	}
}
```

Imagine the first object's count is used to count operations per minute, but the second used for count sheps. The instant the second object records the first sheep, the data of the first object is lost. 

>[!warning]
>If an attribute is static, and the class provides a setter for that attribute, any object that invokes the setter will change the single copy. Thus, the value for the attribute will change for all objects
