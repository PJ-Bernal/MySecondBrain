## How to create a docker container
To build a container, once I have an image in my library execute `Docker container run <name of the image>`.

>[!important]
>- I can create infinite containers using the same image. So each run will create a container.
>- To view all the running container use `docker container ls`, and to view all (container running and not) use `docker container ls -a`.

## How to stop a docker container
If the container is running execute `docker container stop <container id or 3 first characteres, name>`.

## How to start a container
Once the container has been run for the first time, I can initiated again with `docker start <container id or 3 first characteres, name>`
