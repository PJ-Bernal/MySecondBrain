# Built a solution
The green arrow compiles and executes the app, but the built ribbon -> `built solution`, will compile only; if an error is detected, a debugger will open.
## The solution directory/file
When a solution is built, all source code is compiled, and all errors are shown. Once done it continue doing a ‘incremental compilation’, therefore, any code change after the built will trigger a recompile of that specific piece of code, and not the entire solution.
