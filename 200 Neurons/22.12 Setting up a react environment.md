[[12.12 React|React]]

## Setting up the environment
To set up a React environment, use:
- CDN: React is a library, thus a bundler is not "require". So, when testing, I can embed this two imports into the main file. 

```js
import React from 'https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0';
import ReactDOM from 'https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0/client';
```

- Toolchain: like Vite or Next. React require to configure at least a package manager (like npm or yarn), a bundler, a compiler (like babel) and React itself. Thus, using Vite is the best way to set up a React environment.
