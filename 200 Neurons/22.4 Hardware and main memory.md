[[13.4 Linux]]

Main memory is perhaps the most important part of the hardware, it represents a big storage area of bits (0s and 1s), where the running kernel and processes reside. All input and output flow through the main memory is managed by the CPU. 

The term state or image (used when referencing memory, process or kernel), strictly speaking, refers to a specific arrangement of bits. But using abstraction, it describes what something is doing or has done at a certain moment. (Better to say: "the process is waiting for an input", than, the image is 0010 0101 0110.
