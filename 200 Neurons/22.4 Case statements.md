[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Similar to a switch statement from JS. It uses a variable which gets assign the match case. And else clause can be provided to serve as a default no match is found. When the case is found, the match value is return and the case conditional stops execution. 

The use of then allow to write simple case statements

```ruby
grade = 'F'

did_i_pass = case grade #=> create a variable `did_i_pass` and assign the result of a call to case with the variable grade passed in
  when 'A' then "Hell yeah!"
  when 'D' then "Don't tell your mother."
  else "'YOU SHALL NOT PASS!' -Gandalf"
end
```

When the code needs more complexity and space, I can remove `then`.

```ruby
grade = 'F'

case grade
when 'A'
  puts "You're a genius"
  future_bank_account_balance = 5_000_000
when 'D'
  puts "Better luck next time"
  can_i_retire_soon = false
else
  puts "'YOU SHALL NOT PASS!' -Gandalf"
  fml = true
end
```

>Detail each when only specifies the case value, and is not a comparison between two things. 

If I assign the result of the case to a variable, I don't need to put many times:

```ruby
a = 5

answer = case a
  when 5
    "a is 5"
  when 6
    "a is 6"
  else
    "a is neither 5, nor 6"
  end

puts answer
```

## Specific scenario
There is one specific scenario (don't know what yet) in which I can't omit the argument for case. But, generally speaking, if this is the case, better to use the classic if/eslif/else. 

```ruby
a = 5

case
when a == 5
  puts "a is 5"
when a == 6
  puts "a is 6"
else
  puts "a is neither 5, nor 6"
end
```
