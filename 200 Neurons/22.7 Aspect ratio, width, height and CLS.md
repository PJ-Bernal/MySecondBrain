[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML]]

Layout shift is control by including the height and width attributes within the `img` HTML tag. 

[This gif](https://static.snigel.com/uploads/2021/09/cls-small.gif) explains what LS is. 
## Example
>[!multi-column]
>
>![[Pasted image 20240130125307.png]]
>
>This is an example of how to prevent LS. If either the `aspect-ratio` or `wight` attributes are missing, or if `height: max` LS will occur. 

>[!warning]
>- Utilizing `aspect-ratio` by itself won't prevent CL; thus, specifying the `width` and `height` WITHIN The HTML is not required, but on the CSS is. 
>- The `aspect-ratio` value must be the same as the value of the image, so, if the image ratio is 125/83 I can use 16/9; this will generate a minor, but still present, LS. 
>- If for some reason the aspect-ratio value is not available, including both the `height` and `width` attributes within the HTML and CSS will be mandatory to prevent LS. 

The above code also provides responsive thanks to the combination of the `width` attribute and `max-width`.
