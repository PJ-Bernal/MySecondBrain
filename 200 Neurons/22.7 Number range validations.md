[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

I specify a boundary using the `min = <number>;` and `max = <number>;` attributes, that only work with numbers, meaning, data types of number, dates and time. For more control I can use both in one input attribute. 

This is useful for example, to limit the quantity of a product, or when booking a flight.
