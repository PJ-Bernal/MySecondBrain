# About entity classes
Class entities are DTO classes (simple classes) that act as the outer-facing model, and are different from the entities of the Entity model. 

>[!important]
>Not all fields are store in a db becauses the data the API provides is shape differently to the stored in the db. Meaning model classes and entity classes should not have the exact same number of properties. 

## The starting point to create class entities
A good starting point is the model classes and think which properties do I have to persists into the db.

Generally, there are values that can't be calculated from other values of the db, for example, the id, name, or description. However, calculated values that user other values to be generated, like, number of points of interest, can be calculated and don't need to be present in the class entity. 

In the below example, numbers of points of interest don't have to be persisted in the db, therefore, is not part of the entity class.

# Creating entities
Add a new folder named Entities, to have an own namespace, and then add the classes that represent the entities, in this case, the cities and the point of interest.

Remember to initialize the list to an empty list to avoid null reference exceptions when the points of interests haven't been loaded yet.

## About ID and the PK

The convention tells that a property called ID is usually the PK, but `<class name>Id` is another option like: CityId. If the PK has other name, the convention don't apply and the `[Key]` data annotation. However, is a good practice to always include it.


### Generation of the ID PK

By convention PK that are integers will be set up to have values generated when add data to the db, meaning the ID will be an identity column. To explicitly said that use the data base generated annotation which has three possible values: none (no automatic generation), identity (generation on add), computed (generation on add or update); for the PK use identity, so a new PK integer will be created when the city is added.

How the value is generated depends on the db provider, once generate the values automatically, other don't. SQLite will generate this automatically. 

# Create relations between entities
Cities and point of interests are related. City already have the points of interest collection; so the points entity class should have a property that points to city defining what the FK property will be.

## Using the convention for FK
>[!blank-container|float-left-medium]
>![[Pasted image 20250122111121.png]]

By convention, a relationship between a parent and child class entities will be created when there's a navigation property; this is, if the property's type point can't be mapped as a scalar type by the current db provider. In this case, the relation is created because there's a navigation property whose type is City, that by convention has the same name as the parent class. 

Relationships discovered by convention will always target the PK of the principal entity, meaning, the PK of the parent class is CityId, is automatically included as a navigation property in the child class. However, is a good practice to hard-coded there, to show what is the child class FK, for clarity.

>City is neither a FK or PK, is just a navigation property. 

## Hard-coded FK
>[!blank-container|float-left-medium]
>![[Pasted image 20250122112042.png]]

Another way of declaring the FK is using the FK annotation. 

By doing this, for the navigation property City the FK is CityId. 

The convention approach is enough, but this one is more clear. 






# Entity classes and annotations of DTO classes
Some model classes use data annotation validations like `[Require]` which are class-scope, meaning the db could still receive an empty string. 

>[!important]
>Therefore is a good practice to apply those data annotation validations to the lowest possible level, and this is in the entity classes.

Remember the DTO, the model classes, are only use to get data, not to store it. 
# DTO vs entity classes
- DTO don't contain navigation properties and those db annotations.
