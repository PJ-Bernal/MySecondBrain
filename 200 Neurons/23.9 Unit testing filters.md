Filter allow code to run before or after specific stages in the request pipeline. Again, only test custom filters. All filters run within the action invocation pipeline, or the filter pipeline. It runs after .net selects the action to execute.

There are 5 filters.

They run immediately before and after an action method is called. They can change the arguments passed into an action and the result from the action. 

# The test
This is the custom filter. This filter will return a bad request if show statistics header is missing or hasn't got a value of true.

Then apply the filter on an action method or controller.

Then create the test class to test the action filter directly, not the controller.

Start by mocking the dependencies, in this case, `ActionExecutingContext`. First, create the instance of the filter class, it doesn't have any parameters, so do it right now.

Then, the action executing context requires an action context, that requires an http context. Detail the action context requires four arguments, in this test are not required, but they could be.

Finally, new up an action executing context.
