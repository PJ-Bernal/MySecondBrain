[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Works as the opposite of an if statement, processing the code if the expression is false.

```ruby
age = 19
unless age < 18
  puts "Get a job."
end
```

Just like if, I can write the code in one line and include and else if required.

```ruby
age = 19
puts "Welcome to a life of debt." unless age < 18

unless age < 18
  puts "Down with that sort of thing."
else
  puts "Careful now!"
end
```

>[!multi-column]
>
>>If the code inside the if is only one line, I can use a short syntax than don't require the `end` statement. 
>
>```ruby
>puts "x is NOT 3" unless x == 3
>```

>[!info]
>You should use an unless statement when you want to not do something if a condition is true, because it can make your code more readable than using if !true.
