## Using `display: inline-block`
Special value of `display`, just in the middle of `inline` and `block`. Use it if you do not want an item to break onto a new line, but do want it to respect width and height and avoid the overlapping seen above, also top and bottom margins and paddings are respected. With `display: inline;` don't. 

This value will cause:

- Width and height properties are respected.
- Padding, margin, and border will push other elements.
- There is no break line at the 'end' of the element, this allow side by side boxes. 
- The box will become larger than its content if a width or height is explicitly added.

In practice, I'll use more flexbox than inline-block. But more inline-block than floats. 

>[!idea] Use case
>This can be useful to give a link a larger hit area by adding padding. `<a>` is an inline element like `<span>`; you can use display: inline-block to allow padding to be set on it, making it easier for a user to click the link.

>In this example the span has an inline-block value.

>[!example] Use case is navigation bars
>The `ul` box is displaying using flexbox whereas the `a` box is inline, therefore, top an bottom values don't push other boxes and ended up overlapping.

>To avoid this, change the display of the inline element to `display: inline-block`.

>[!example]- Use case to avoid incongruence
>![[Pasted image 20240205110314.png]]
>Span is an inline block; using display:block break the container block `p`. But, with `inline-block` this don't happen.
