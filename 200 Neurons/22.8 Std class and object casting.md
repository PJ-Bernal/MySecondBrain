[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

Std classes are used to create generic objects; and also some functions return instances of the std class.

>The browser prints the objects as arrays , the syntax is almost the same, BUT, as an example, in the next image a is THE ATTRIBUTE and 1 is the value; a IS NOT the a key. 
## With JSON files
Assume a JSON string, then I want to decode that into an array using `json_decode()` function, whose first parameter is the JSON and the second is a boolean (true to return an associative array).

When the second parameter is empty, I get an object, which is an instance of the stdClass, and the keys of the JSON (or the array) will become the properties of the class and the values, the valued of those keys.

Now, I can access the properties using the `->` object operator.

## Create custom objects
Using the std class itself, and then adding public properties. Because I'm creating an object, the following code is setting up the attributes and values of that object. So `a` is the attribute name and `1` is the value of that attribute.

## Casting
### Array to object
To cast, use the regular casting `(object)$array`. In this case, the keys transforms into the attributes and the values of the array are the values of those properties.

To access the values, use the numeric indexes within `{ }`.

### Int to object (Scalar)
![[Pasted image 20240312202941.png]]
In this case, Scalar is the attribute and 1 is the value. Because scalar is the property I can access the value like this.

Detail I'm accessing the attribute using the object operator as any other object.

>[!important]
>An scalar is the property of integers, booleans, strings and floats. 

### Null to object
Null is cast to an empty object, with no properties.
