[[13.1 OO Programming|OOP]]

A strong OO design is based on understanding the difference between interface and implementation (is vital for a class design what the user needs to know, and even more importantly, what the user doesn't need to know; all of this is accomplished thanks to data hiding).

>[!warning]- GUI vs interface
>The term interface in OO implies more than an interface from a GUI; it isn't restricted to it.

The implementation is of little concern to the user; however, any user should be able to recognize and use the interface. Likewise, a change in the implementation should have no impact on the user (unless that change results in a better or worse experience), whereas a change to the interface might. 

>[!info] End users vs developers
>When thinking in terms of objects (the chapter's name), the user refers not only to end users but designers and developers; thus, interfaces in this context are about class interfaces and not GUIs. 
## Class design
Classes are designed in two parts, the interfaces and the implementation. Perhaps, the most important consideration when designing a class is identifying the audience, or users, of the class.
### Interface
The services presented to an end-user constitute the interface. As a general rule, the interface to a class should _only_ contain what the user needs to know, the services (they might be a matter of opinion).

>If the interface is designed properly, a change to the implementation shouldn't require a change to the user's code. 

The interface includes the syntax for the programmer to call a method and return a value. If the interface doesn't change, the user doesn't care whether the implementation is changed. In business, and for end users, little changes could affect their experience.

>[!warning]- public interface
>When a programmer can access it, thus, it's considered part of the class interface. Don't confuse interface with the key word `interface` of Java and .NET.

[question:: There are public and private interfaces? If there are, what is the reason to have a private interface ]
### Implementation
Hidden from the user. A change to it shouldn't require a change to the user's code. Read [[23.1 Encapsulation and data hiding#Implementation|implementation]] for more information about implementation. 
### Example 
Create a database _reader_ class (not the database itself) used for programmers, thus an API, not GUI, is required.

The methods are wrappers that enclose the database requirements because database functionality customization is required.

>[!Info]- Questions to use the class
Now, to use the class, let's answer the following questions: to effectively use this class, do you, as a programmer, need to know anything else about it? Do you need to know how the internal database code opens the database? Do you need to know how the internal database code physically positions itself over a specific record? Do you need to know how the internal database code determines whether any more records are left?

The answer is no. To use the class I don't need to know what the code (the implementation) looks like in the private and public methods and its attributes.

>>The implementation changed three times, but the interface (how to use the methods and their return values) remains the same.
