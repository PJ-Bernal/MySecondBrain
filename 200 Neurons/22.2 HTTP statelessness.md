## Statelessness of HTTP
A <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">stateless protocol</mark> happens when the <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">request/response</mark> pair is <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">completely independent</mark> of the previous one. <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">HTTP</mark> <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">is stateless</mark> (resilient protocol), therefore the server doesn't need to retain any user information of past interactions (each request is a brand new entity) or between request. Thus, the server don't use resources storing information, and if the request gets corrupted, it don't do any clean up. 

>[!example]
>- When I log in to see Facebook's home page, one complete request/response cycle has happened; the same when I click a picture, send a message, etc. And I'm not expecting to be logged out after every action. If HTTP is stateless, how the app maintain state and remember my user name and password? Or how differentiate data from my and other user? This is another topic. But always remember even though I feel the app is stateful, the website is built on HTTP, a stateless protocol. 

Stateful simulation can be made via sessions, cookies and Asynchronous JavaScript calls, or AJAX.

## Sessions
A session is created when the server sends the client a unique token (usually a random string) that is append as part of each new request to be identified by the server. This token is call `session identifier`.

>Once the session id is store in the client side in the form of a cookie, is added to every request to identify the session. Thus, When a user's username and password match, the session id is stored on their browser so that on the next request they won't have to re-authenticate.

The back and forth `session id` interchange, generates some sort of persistent connection between requests (neither the server or the client retain the token), though are technically stateless.

### Session flaws
>1. Every request must be inspected to see if it contains a session id. 
>2. If the request has a session id, the server has to validate if it's still valid. 
>3. The server has to have rules regard session expiration and data session storage.
>4. The server needs to retrieve the session data based on the session id only.
>5. The server needs to recreate an appropriate application state from the session data (for example, if my Facebook background color is black, the server can't response with a white color)

As a consequence, the sever has to double-march work to simulate a stateful experience, as every request still get its own response even if they are identical. Of course, there are session optimization techniques and security concerns. 

>[!warning]- Example of server extra work
>(This is an hypothetical example as Facebook use Ajax, not sessions). If you're logged into Facebook, the server has to generate the initial page you see, and the response is a pretty complex and expensive HTML that your browser displays. The Facebook server has to add up all the likes and comments for every photo and status, and present it in a timeline for you. It's a very expensive page to generate. Now if you click on the "like" link for a photo, Facebook has to regenerate that entire page. It has to increment the like count for that photo you liked, and then send that HTML back as a response, even though the vast majority of the page stayed the same.

Also, the session id is unique and expires in a relatively short time. 
## Cookies
Data send from the server (when accessing the first time) to the client, and stored in the browser during the request/response cycle, that contain session information (that is store in the server). 

On every request/cycle, the client side cookie is compared with the server-side session data to identify the current session. Because the cookie is store, if the browser is closed and the pc shut down, the cookie would still persist. 

>[!example]- reviewing cookies with the browser inspector
>When opening a website for the first time, the request headers won't have a cookie header, but the response headers set the first cookie.
>![[Pasted image 20231106165511 1.png]]
>
>Different when I have already visited the website in which the request header have a cookie (from a previous visit that let the server identify the client) and sent issue a new request with it, and the response sets a new cookie.
>![[Pasted image 20231106165842 1.png|center]]

### Browser inspector and cookies
Within the inspector, under the 'Storage > Cookies' tab are all the cookies contain with the initial request (with the initial response header).

![[Pasted image 20231106172103 1.png|center|600]]

After log in, a `session id` appears and will be present in all future requests, thus the server can identify every client. 

![[Pasted image 20231106172403 1.png|center|600]]

When the server receives a requests with a session id, it'll look for the associated data to it, then 'remember' and respond with an appropriate application state (the session id is store on the client is used as a key to the session data store in the server side).

>[!tip]- Where the session data is store?
>Somewhere in the server, could be on a persistent storage, like a database or key/value store.



## AJAX
AJAX (short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a combination of  HTML or XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, XML (JSON is better), XSLT, and most importantly the XMLHttpRequest object. Those allow webpages to make quick, incremental updates to the user interface without reloading the entire browser page, making the app faster and more user responsive. 

AJAX most appealing characteristic its is Asynchronous nature that allows the client to have request/respond cycles without a full page refresh

>[!example]
>Google uses AJAX as every interaction changes the user interface in respond to every letter or interaction make.
>
>Detail the 'neutral' state and the only request. As soon as letter are typed, the browser issue request/respond cycles and changes the webpage according to that.
>
>![[Pasted image 20231106192544 1.png]]

Every AJAX request is handled by a `callback`, that's nothing more than a piece of logic information that does something an event has happened. In the Google case, the call back is trigger when the response is returned.
