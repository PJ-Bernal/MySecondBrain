For mocking in .NET use `moq`, it can produce a stub, dummy and mock. 

# Creating a mock
Install moq. Create a new class.  

This is going to be the test to re write using a mock. The image only paste a unit test from other class.

Detail this test has two dependencies given from the repo and the factory. So, instead of using the factory, create a mock, passing the type to mock. Abstract classes and interfaces can be mocked, in this, case the code is mocking a class. 

To pass the mock object as a dependency call `.Object`.

Now the mock is used to create an instance of the type employee, that is used by the employee service class. What this mock is mocking is the factory class, but the class is not being use in the test implementation, only a mock object is created.

When the class is used, like in this other test.

The create internal employee is a field of the factory class.

However, when the test runs, it fails. This happens because the `employee` variable is created using the `EmployeeFactory`, and what I provide on the test is a mock of the factory, but I neve set the `CreteEmployee` method. 

This means the mock object don't have that method implemented.

To avoid this, the mock objects need to be configured.
