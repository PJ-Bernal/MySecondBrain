[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

APIs lack of an user interface to input a user name and password, meaning, authentication relies only in the request to send something to the API, which then validates the identity of the client. 

Some of the things that can be validates care cookies with an encrypted authentication ticket, API keys, tokens, etc.  

The validation could be made by an specific endpoint, and when verify, the proof of authentication is send via cookie or a key. However, a standard approach use an external component called the Identity Provider; in this case, the API don't check, and shouldn't have access, to the client's credentials, but the credentials are in the IDP. This approach use OAuth and OpenID. 

This approach is better as it leverage the need for creating and configuring a custom token management system.
