## Compatibility for enhance objects
If an object have to change, erasing a property for example, all of the instantiated objects will produce an error, so I might have to manually look for all of them an change the property.

Imagine I have this first version of the User object.

```js
function User(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

let john = new User("John", 25);

alert( john.age ); // 25
```

If then I want to updated to this. 

```js
function User(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.birthday = birthday;
}

let john = new User("John", 25);
// Uncaught ReferenceError: birthday is not define at new User
```

Imagine I have 100 objects, after that change all of them are broke. However, adding a getter will keep the old property and don't break the already created objects. This is know as the accessor descriptor. 

```js
function User(name, birthday) {
  this.name = name;
  this.birthday = birthday;

  // age is calculated from the current date and birthday
  Object.defineProperty(this, "age", {
    get() {
      let todayYear = new Date().getFullYear();
      return todayYear - this.birthday.getFullYear();
    }
  });
}

let john = new User("John", new Date(1992, 6, 1));

alert( john.birthday ); // birthday is available
```

Detail inside of the object I have my two data properties and an additional one `age`, that is the descriptor property.


This is an example on how to use `defineProperty`. Look, the first parameter is the object. If I'm using the descriptor inside of the object, I must use `this`, as above. The second parameter is the name of the property, and after that is either a getter or setter without a name, look is `get() {}` and not `get accesorProperryName () {}`. 

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  surname: "Smith"
};

Object.defineProperty(user, 'fullName', {
  get() {
    return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;
  },

  set(value) {
    [this.name, this.surname] = value.split(" ");
  }
});
```
