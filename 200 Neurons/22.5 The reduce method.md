Reduce expects a callback function, that takes two arguments:
- Accumulator, which is the current value of the result at that point in the loop. The first time through, this value will either be set to the initialValue (described in the next bullet point), or the first element in the array if no initialValue is provided. Current is the item currently being iterated on.
- initialValue, is the second parameter, **after the callback**. which helps when we don’t want our initial value to be the first element in the array.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const productOfAllNums = arr.reduce((total, currentItem) => {
  return total * currentItem;
}, 1);
// accumulator = total
// currentItem = current
// 1 = initial value
console.log(productOfAllNums); // Outputs 120;
console.log(arr); // Outputs [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

So what .reduce() will do, is it will once again go through every element in arr and apply the callback function to it. It then changes total, without actually changing the array itself. After it’s done, it returns total.
