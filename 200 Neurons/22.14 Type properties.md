[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

Ideally, objects should be protected after they are instantiated. To do that, type property definitions have extra properties. 
## Readonly
Prevent a property to be change once the object has been instantiated. This property **don't** make the code immutable for JS, it only protect object mutation during the compilation. In this example, detail JS don't care about the error, and it will execute the last line altering the name. **TS won't make the JS immutable**, the code looks the same.
