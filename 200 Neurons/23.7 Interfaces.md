# About interfaces
Contract with a set of declarations of related functionality, could be a list of methods. The methods listed in the interface, will have an implementation **in the class**. 

Using an interface grants the use of implemented methods. 

Interfaces are reference types.

Use the interface keyword and the uppercase i at the begging of the interface name. 

Within the interface body, I must list all the methods that have an implementation for all the types using the interface. 

# Use an interface on a class
Just add `: I<interfaceName>`. This indicates the class will be using through an interface. 

# No instances of interface
Interfaces can't create instances: `IEmployee testEmployee = new IEmployee()`; this will trigger an error. 

However the variables can have the interface type, so they can use all the members list on that interface.

Detail, in this case, the interface is a list of methods. Thus, the interface grants all employee types, those methods have an implementation. 

Detail there is no access modifier.

I want to make sure that classes that implement this interface, that they will give an implementation.

Now, "attaching" the implementation to the class means all the members, in this case methods, defined in the interface have an implementation inside of the employee class.

If a member is listed on the interface, but is not present/implement in the class, the compiler will detect this as an error.

## Use the interface in the program

Doing this, all variables can use all members list on the employee interface. This is using the interface reference to point to classes that implement the interface directly or via the parent. Now, all objects implement the methods list on the interface. 
# Uses for interface
The interface grants members within it will have an implementation or will be present, therefore, thanks to poly, the right version will be used.
