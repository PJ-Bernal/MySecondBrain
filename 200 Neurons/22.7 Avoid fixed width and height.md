Fixed width make things inflexible; `width: 600px` in this case, the element will never shrink or stretch. The same goes with a fixed height, when an element is getting out of room.

A general solution will be replacing `width` or `height` with `max-width` or `min-height` (`min-width` and `max-height` are also valid and may be useful depending on the context).

## Avoid heights altogether
Most elements don't require to set a height value (exception to headers and footers). Is better to use margin and padding to increase space around the element; those two will keep the elements flexible no matter what the element's content is.

## When fixed widths are appropriate
Elements with smaller widths should have a fixed width, for example, an icon of 32px is not going to benefit from using `max-width` because I don't want the element to shrink.
