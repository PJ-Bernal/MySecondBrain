# Inheritance
When certain CSS properties are inherit from the parent to the elements descendants, even if no explicit rule has been written for them. Typography-based properties (`color`, `font-size`, `font-family`, etc.) are usually inherited.

>>This doesn't apply when a ruleset is target to an element. Target ruleset beats inheritance.

>>The parent has a higher specificity, but the child has been target with a ruleset, thus, the parent will be red and the child blue.
