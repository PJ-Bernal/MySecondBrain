## Built-in browser functions
>Pretty much anytime you make use of a JavaScript structure that features a pair of parentheses — `( )` — and you're not using a common built-in language structure like a for loop, while or do...while loop, or if...else statement, you are making use of a function.

[This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects) is a full lists of the built-in functions, built-in objects and their methods.
## Functions vs methods
- Function: are defined with the function keyword or as arrow functions (=>) and can be invoked independently.

```js
// Function declaration
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Function expression
const greet = function(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

// Arrow function
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;

// Invoking a function independently
console.log(greet('Alice'));  // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

- Methods: functions that are part of objects. Methods are invoked using the object they belong to. 

```js
const person = {
    name: 'Alice',
    greet: function() {
        return `Hello, ${this.name}!`;
    }
};

// Invoking a method
console.log(person.greet());  // Output: Hello, Alice!
```
## Invoking functions
To invoke a function, include its name followed by a parenthesis. 

```js
console.log(greet('Alice'));  // Output: Hello, Alice!
```
