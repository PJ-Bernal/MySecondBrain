# What is a member
A member is any element that belongs to a type (class or struct), like fields, properties, methods, constructors, events, etc.

Each member has a special way to be used, for example, to use a method use dot notation, to use a constructor use the `new` keyword.

For primitives, use the primitive name and dot, to access methods, for example: `int intMaxValue = int.MaxValue;` All primitive have several built in member.
