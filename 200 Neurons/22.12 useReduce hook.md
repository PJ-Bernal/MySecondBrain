[[12.12 React|React]]

Use the `useReducer` hook that takes the reducer function and an initial state as arguments, then it return an array with two values, the current state and a dispatch function. This function receives an action object as argument, which is passed to the reducer function, and the return value is used to updated the state.

```jsx
// Now let's see how we would use this in a component
function ShoppingCart() {
  const [cartState, dispatch] = useReducer(cartReducer, { items: [] });

  const addItem = (product) => {
    // When something goes wrong, we can see exactly what action was dispatched
    dispatch({ 
      type: ACTIONS.ADD_TO_CART, 
      payload: product 
    });
  };
}
```

Similar to the `set` function in `setState`, react only updates the state in the next render after calling the dispatch function. Keep in mind that these functions use Object.is() to determine if the state has changed, if it hasn’t, then the component won’t re-render.

## Re-renders and creating-editing same objects
When using a reducer, always create a new object and modifying it. Editing or changing a prop is not creating a new object, so the reduce won't trigger a new render. 

```jsx
const ACTIONS = {
  INCREMENT: 'INCREMENT',
  ADD_TODO: 'ADD_TODO'
};

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ACTIONS.INCREMENT: {
      // This is INCORRECT - modifying state directly
      // Component won't re-render because Object.is() sees the same object reference
      state.count += 1;
      return state;
    }

    case ACTIONS.ADD_TODO: {
      // This is CORRECT - creating a new state object
      // Component will re-render because Object.is() sees a new object reference
      return {
        ...state,
        todos: [...state.todos, action.payload]
      };
    }

    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function TodoApp() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, {
    count: 0,
    todos: []
  });

  const addTodo = (text) => {
    dispatch({
      type: ACTIONS.ADD_TODO,
      payload: { id: Date.now(), text }
    });
  };

  const increment = () => {
    dispatch({ type: ACTIONS.INCREMENT });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment (Won't Work)</button>
      <button onClick={() => addTodo('New Todo')}>Add Todo (Will Work)</button>
      <ul>
        {state.todos.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- `{...state}`: the spread operator takes all existing properties from the old state and place them into a new object. 
- `todos: [...state.todos, action.payload]`: create a new array for todos, the spread again copy all existing todos into a new array, and then add the new todo at the end.
