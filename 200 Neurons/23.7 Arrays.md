# About arrays
Useful when working with a fixed number of items of the **same** type. Arrays are a built-in data structure within C#, with zero-index based. 

>[!important]+
>- Arrays are reference types, meaning an array instance is needed. 
>- All array element, even value types, are placed in the heap. So a integer value type, will be a reference type if its inside an array. 
>- Array size cannot be change. The only option is to create a new array, copy all elements and add if required.
## Creating an array

To initialize and declare an array, `<type>[] nameOfTheArray = new int[<number of elements>`; for example: `int[] studentIds = new int[10];`.  

**Only** when the array is declared when creating an instance (initializing an array won't created it in memory), the memory is allocated. At this point, the array elements are created with default values. 

The default values for custom classes (like user defined classes) is null. 

## Defining the size at runtime
When developing the array's size could be unknown, therefore, to determine the array during runtime, use a variable when instantiating the array.

```c#
int size = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
int[] employeeIds = new int[size];
```

## Populate array with data
There are several ways to add data to an array. This could be any kind of value. 

```c#
// Pass values when instantiating using {}
int [] allEmployeeIds = new int[4] {1, 5, 10, 50};

// This will trigger an error, there are three data values only 
int [] allEmployeeIds = new int[4] {1, 5}

// This is possible, ommiting the size of the array but passing the values
int [] allEmployeeIds = new int[] {1, 5, 10}
```

If array values are unknow when instantiating, use the [] notation: `allEmployeeIds[0] = 123;`

## Accessing data
Use bracket notation `int firstElement = allEmployeeIds[0];`. 

The C# compiler cannot detect out-of-bounds array access at compile time because array bounds are typically determined dynamically at runtime
# Collections
useful when the number of items can grow or shrink.
