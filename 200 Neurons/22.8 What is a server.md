## What is a web server?
A web server is either hardware (computer that stores the web server software source, among other things) and/or software. This server can process incoming requests using different protocols, typically the HTTP, generated by web browsers to view and communicate with web pages. 

A web server can host either a single or multiple websites using the same resources using a virtual host, that allows the server to allocate and share resources across multiple websites.
