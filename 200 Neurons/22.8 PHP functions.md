## Where to define functions 
Functions can be defined after their calling (unless its a conditional function), but is a good practice to define every function at the top. 
## Declaring functions conditionally 
>[!multi-column]
>
>Using conditionally defined functions, the condition has to be true in order to call that function. In this case the condition is false so the function can’t be called.

>[!multi-column]

>In this case, the condition is true, but it also returns an error even the condition is true because the parser first try to call the function, but the condition is below.

## Functions within functions or inner functions
Functions in PHP have global scope so they can be called outside its father function, as long as the father function is called first. Also, calling a father function don’t execute the child function. In this case the father function is executed.

In this other case, the father function hasn’t been called so an error is trigger.

>[!warning]
Is not recommended to use inner functions or conditional functions, it makes code harder to read.

## Return types and strict types
>[!multi-column]
>
>Functions can return a hardcoded data type. If not `declare(strict_type=1)` is used, PHP will coerce as possible and if not, for example return an array and hardcode a return type of int, an error will appear.

When strict type is active, I'm forcing the function to give me a desire data type, without any casting. 

Also, void data type will return null even if the return code is empty `return ;` or there is no return statement. However, writing `return null;` this will trigger an error. 

>[!multi-column]
>
>In this case the error is trigger because the return statement is no loger void, it is something that is null.

### Union types
>[!multi-column]
>
>Since PHP 8 I can return multiple data types separated by palito, I can use several data types here.
>
>![[Pasted image 20240308001800.png]]

### Mixed return type
>[!multi-column]
>When a function is expected to return multiple data types, instead of typing all of them just use the `mixed` word. Mixed include the null data type, so there's no need to use the nullable operator `?`. 
>
>![[Pasted image 20240308001846.png]]

>It has very specific use cases, and is better to explicitly tell the function what value to return. So is not common to use. 

### Nullable values 
>[!multi-column]
>
>When a function can return some data type but also null, I can use the nullable syntax to tell PHP the specified data type can be return but also null
>
>![[Pasted image 20240308085727.png]]
### Within classes 
I can use self or the class name as a return type within classes.
