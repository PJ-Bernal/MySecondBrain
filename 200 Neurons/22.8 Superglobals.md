[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]
Pre-defined variables or built-in variables are predefine variables that exists inside PHP, these are called superglobals. I can access a superglobal from anywhere inside PHP, regardless the scope.

To access a superglobal variable use `_` followed by the name in capital letters. `_SERVER` and `[ ];`. like `_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"];`


## SERVER
`$_SERVER`  is an array containing information such as headers, paths, and script locations., in this case, the index.php `_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"];`That's the location of the website in my computer. Detail the PHP_SELF return the path of the php file on the root project folder.

## GET
An associative array of variables passed to the current script via the URL parameters (aka. query string).

In this case all that is inside of the URL is the key pair name=dani.

## POST
It submit data, but not in the URL as GET. The general rule is: to get data from a database or a just data to show the user, use GET. If I want to submit, use POST.

## REQUEST
This superglobal looks for GET, POST and cookies, when looking for data inside the website. The problem is that using request I really don't know what I'm grabbing whenever the user submit somethig. 
## FILES
Use to get data about a file that has been uploaded to the my server. 
## COOKIE
Small file that my server embeds in the user's computer, use this SG to store or grab information about cookies. 
## SESSION
