# About the csproj file

The project is not a directory but an XML file containing properties for the whole project.  The next image shows a default csproj file for a ASP.NET Core app.

Remember this file is not explicitly shown in the solution explorer, but is in the pc.  

## Project note
This is the first line in the csproje file, which the SDK property is The Microsoft.net.sdk.web; which is the default for ASP.NET Core projects. This property reference the ASP.NET Core shared framework, AKA; MIcrosofot.aspNetCore.App. This reference brings support for many of the common types used in an ASP.NET Core app. a bunch of refences to assemblies (developed by Microsoft) )almost every ASP.NET Core app will need.

The image shows the referenced framework is already in the dependencies folder.

## Property group
Contains general project properties. It says the app will be using .NET 8, and by default the template will also enable nullable reference types, which is now a default, and also allows implicit using ([[23.7 Custom types - BCL contains custom types - namespace - global usings|global usings]]are available, so the classes don't have using at the start of the file); that generate, at compile time a list of global using statements that will contain the using common in ASP.NET Core projects, so I don’t have to repeat them again. 

Since the generated using are global, there’s no need to repeat them anymore in other files. This is the same as global usings. 

# References to packages
The default csproj file don’t contain references to other packages. However within the project's dependencies directory are two Microsoft framework packages which implicitly import other packages, meaning, most classes use within the app don’t require to bring another package.

Only classes that are not within those frameworks are required to be added manually as dependencies.  

## Adding dependencies
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20250119151347.png]]

To add dependencies use the itemgroup property 

If adding references is needed during development that are not available by default in the ASP.NET Core shared framework, add those references to  other packages.

For example, if I need NuGet, the result is a reference to the package added in the csproj file.
