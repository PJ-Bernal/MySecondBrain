## Setting up a grid
### Grid container
An element which contains the property `display: grid` or `display: inline-grid` will turn into a container containing a whole grid, and its children elements will be automatically grid elements (I don't have to a assign each child a specific property).

>[!important] Only direct children become grid elements
>The paragraph element is not a grid element. However, as in flexbox, I can make child grid element, new grid parents.
```HTML
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2
    <p>I am not a grid item!</p>
  </div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
</div>

```

### Columns and rows
>[!multi-column]
>
>Any grid layout is made of lines, and the space between those lines is a track; to control it I can specify a column and a row track, with the `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties. Each value will define a new track, meaning, each value will "create" a new space between lines, therefore, a new grid column/row.

>[!important] 
>- Grid tracks doesn't affect an element's padding or margin. 
>- Columns and rows tracks don't have to share the same values.

Grid tracks have a shorthand: `grid-template` to define the tracks for rows and columns at once. 

```CSS
/* styles.css */

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template: 50px 50px / 50px 50px 50px;
}
```
