[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

Recursive types are types that refer to themselves to define complex, nested structures like trees, linked lists or recursive data types. This is useful, for example, for defining a JSON.

```ts
type NestedNumbers = number | NestedNumbers[]
 
const val: NestedNumbers = [3, 4, [5, 6, [7], 59], 221]
```

Recursive type works as recursive functions looking at the types defined at the right hand side of the =. What is there defined what the nested type is about. In the above example, the number type define there is going to be a nested type of numbers.

```ts
interface TreeNode<T> {
    value: T;
    children: TreeNode<T>[]; // Recursive reference
}

// Usage
const tree: TreeNode<string> = {
    value: "root",
    children: [
        {
            value: "child1",
            children: [],
        },
        {
            value: "child2",
            children: [
                {
                    value: "grandchild1",
                    children: [],
                },
            ],
        },
    ],
};

console.log(tree.children[1]?.children[0]?.value); // "grandchild1"
```
