# About collections
Collections are classes built into .NET that offer more flexibility to work with groups of data than arrays. 

List is one class, and the most commonly used. 

All collection classes are generic classes 

>Is a good practice to always initialize to an empty collection to avoid null reference issues. 
## Generic lists or `List<T>`
Generic lists use the syntax `List<T>`, with T meaning any type. 

To create a list `List<type> <variableName> = new List<type>();` Lists contains a **single** value type, helping with type safety. There is not need to specify a size, it'll change dynamically. 

As always, Lists have several members, for example, the property `.Count`. 

### Add or remove list items
With a list object, then use member methods to add or remove items.
