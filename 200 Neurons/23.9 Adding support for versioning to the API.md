[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

There are two ways of versioning: via [[23.9 Versioning the API|query strings]] or using routes (more common).

For this notes, the authentication will be disable to apply versioning, then it'll be reinstated and apply authentication with versioning.

# Adding and configuring the service
Add the `asp.versioning.mvc` package, then register the service where:
- `setUpAction`: object use to configure the services.
- `ReportApiVersions`: allow to return the version of the API if true.
- `.AddMvc()`: enable support for ASP.NET Core MVC API, this is, when an API is using controllers and routing.

>[!important]
>Simply adding `Ã€ddApiVersioning` is not enough, it won't add the MVC-specific services.

```c#
builder.Services.AddApiVersioning(setUpAction =>
{
  setUpAction.ReportApiversions = true; 
}).AddMvc();
```

## Common error
This error happens when the URL request don't specify a version, and a default version has not been configured to be return by the API in this case.

# ## Configure the service to provide a default api version
That new configuration will make **all the endpoints** (meaning the endpoints for the authentication and the files controller will be version 1)be version 1 of the api, and now the api now how to handle request when no specific versioning is requested:
-	`AssumeDefaultVersionWhenUnspecified`: when no specific version is specified, a default version is assumed. 
-	`DefaultApiVersion`: set the default api version. The first parameter tells the version.

Detail when send a request without a specific version, there's a new header in the response telling the version.
