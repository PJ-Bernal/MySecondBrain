[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

There are two ways of sending request when the api has different versions: via [[23.9 Versioning the API|query strings]] (`https://root/api/authors?version=v1`), version the whole URI (`https://root/api/v1/authors`, or `https://root/api/v2/authors`), using a custom header (`X-version; "v1"`), using an accept header (`Accept: "application/json;version=v1"`), or media types (`Accept: "application/vnd.marvin.book.v1+json`).  

Now, one thing is API versioning and another thing is Open API specification. 

For this notes, the authentication will be disable to apply versioning, then it'll be reinstated and apply authentication with versioning.

# Before adding versioning
Is better that the specifications match the api versions, so creating specification groups is not always the best solution. So, delete the api explorer settings in both controllers.

And re adjust the swagger ui.

# Adding and configuring the service
Add the `asp.versioning.mvc` package, then register the service where:
- `setUpAction`: object use to configure the services.
- `ReportApiVersions`: allow to return the version of the API if true.
- `.AddMvc()`: enable support for ASP.NET Core MVC API, this is, when an API is using controllers and routing.

Also install the `Api.Versioning.Mvc.ApiExplorer`.  

Then add the service api versioning, the report api versions, it will show the version of the resource. Finally chain add mvc to enable support for .net mvc apis. 

>[!important]
>Simply adding `Ã€ddApiVersioning` is not enough, it won't add the MVC-specific services.

Also chain the api explorer. 

![[Pasted image 20250227125901.png|center|350]]

Up to this point the controllers are not part of any particular version, meaning all endpoints will be version 1.

Nothing is showing up, because the specification is not aware that the api now has versioning. 

![[Pasted image 20250227130000.png]]

# Make aware the specification of the api versioning
I need to add one or more specifications depending on how many versions are supported. To know which version to add, use the version-aware api explorer. First, create an instance. 

![[Pasted image 20250227130244.png]]

Then in the swagger doc.

The og code

![[Pasted image 20250227130308.png]]

I need to run through the available API descriptions on the api version description provider and create specifications for each version.

![[Pasted image 20250227130413.png]] 

# Add swagger endpoints for the specification
In swagger UI.

The og code.
![[Pasted image 20250227130529.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250227130542.png]]

Finally, the api versions are there.

![[Pasted image 20250227130609.png]]

Now when using an endpoint, the default way of versioning is by query strings.

![[Pasted image 20250227130942.png]]

If I type 1 and hit try.

![[Pasted image 20250227131012.png]]

# Common error
This error happens when the URL request don't specify a version, and a default version has not been configured to be return by the API in this case.

![[Pasted image 20250202174554.png|center|450]]

# ## Configure the service to provide a default api version
That new configuration will make **all the endpoints** (meaning the endpoints for the authentication and the files controller will be version 1)be version 1 of the api, and now the api now how to handle request when no specific versioning is requested:
-	`AssumeDefaultVersionWhenUnspecified`: when no specific version is specified, a default version is assumed. 
-	`DefaultApiVersion`: set the default api version. The first parameter tells the version.


![[Pasted image 20250202175057.png|center|450]]

Detail when send a request without a specific version, there's a new header in the response telling the version.
