Large numbers of events impact performance because each event handler is a function which is also an object that takes up memory (more objects = less performance) and it takes time to assign all the event handlers, which causes a delay in the interactivity of the page.

To solve this I can create a single event handler for all the events (all the events should be under the same node parent). So, event delegation refers to the technique of using event bubbling to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated.

```HTML
<ul id="menu">
    <li><a id="home">home</a></li>
    <li><a id="dashboard">Dashboard</a></li>
    <li><a id="report">report</a></li>
</ul>
```

```javascript
const menu = document.querySelector('#menu');

menu.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    let target = event.target;

    switch(target.id) {
        case 'home':
            console.log('Home menu item was clicked');
            break;
        case 'dashboard':
            console.log('Dashboard menu item was clicked');
            break;
        case 'report':
            console.log('Report menu item was clicked');
            break;
    }
});
```

This is a clear example of event bubbling, because even I click the `a`, the event bubbles to the parent `menu` that handles the event and executed the listener.
