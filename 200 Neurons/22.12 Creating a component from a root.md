## Creating the root
Components render inside of an HTML element defining a tree of components.

The first step is grabbing the element and then create a root of the tree. After that use the render method whose argument is what I want to render.

```js
import ReactDOM from 'https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0/client';

const DOMElement = document.querySelector('app'); // Grab element
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(DOMElement); // Create root 
root.render('<button>Test</button>);
```

However, the render's argument shouldn't be plain HTML code as react will render that as plain text. This is a security feature to prevent JS injections.

Therefore, is required to create an element, and then, indicate it to render that. 
## Creating the element
To create the element, import React and use the `React.createElement(type, props, ...children)` method:
- type: valid React component type or HTML element to create.
- props: object or null used as the element properties.
- children: optional parameter, can be zero or more. One thing is the element "plain", and the children is "the content" of the element. 

```js
import React from 'https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0';
import ReactDOM from 'https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0/client';

// Capturing the element and create the root
const DOMElement = document.querySelector('#app');
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(DOMElement);

// Creating the element
const button = React.createElement('button', {'data-id': 123, 'Me gusta')

root.render(button);
```

>- React only renders element, not plain text. 
>- Render only renders one element at a time, so I can't pass several elements to the method. 

## How to display several elements
Render will only render one element, but that element can have or involve several elements. In this case, create a wrapper element and then render that element. 

```js
const button = React.createElement('button', {'data-id': 123}, 'Me gusta');
const button2 = React.createElement('button', {'data-id': 456}, 'Me gusta');
const div = React.createElement('div', null, [button, button2]);
root.render(div);
```

Though I can use a div to wrap things, that will add an 'undesired' element to the DOM, thus use `React.Fragment` that acts as a invisible node wrapper element.

```js
const button = React.createElement('button', {'data-id': 123}, 'Me gusta');
const button2 = React.createElement('button', {'data-id': 456}, 'Me gusta');
const wrap = React.createElement(React.Fragment, null, [button, button2]);
root.render(wrap);
```

>Up to this point, the code is not declarative yet, because the code 'describe' all the steps from the creation of the element, since the rendering. To make the code really declarative, use JSX.
