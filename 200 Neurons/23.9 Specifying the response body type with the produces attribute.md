The attribute allows to restrict the response format, given by the media type, for an specific action method, controller or globally. Swashbuckle look that attribute and adjust the open api specification.

This example applies the attribute at controller level, but if an action method return something else, I can be specific and that action method attribute will override the controller attribute.

Detail the `text/json` is not on the list any more.

Now, imagine the APPI now supports XML. The og code.

Then add support for xml.

By default the `ReturnHttpNotAcceptable` is set to false, in the above code is commented to use this default false value. This statement ensure that a 406 not acceptable is returned when an accept header is passed through with format that isn't supported.

Now, in postman, if I request an xml to the books, detail I got back json, even though all controllers support xml. This happens because of the `Produces` attribute.

I can add the supported format to the Produces attribute. And now the format is there.

But, what happen if the request specify an accept header for an unsupported media type. The response is JSON, which is not good, a well designed API should not return a default media type, but a 406. This behavior is created by the Produces attribute, who returns the first media type passed (json, in this example), when an unsupported media type is passed in the accept header.

When the Return Http Not accept is not set to true or is not hard-coded, its default value is false, and the API when an unsupported media type is requested will return a default media type, json.

Now the api returns 406.
