[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

Some npm community plugins like [this one](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base#eslint-config-airbnb-base-) turn on some styles that may clash with prettier formats. In this specific case, I will also need to install [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) which will turn off any of the clashing ESLint rules. 

Using the default ESLint ruleset don't need this.
