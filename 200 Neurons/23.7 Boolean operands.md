# Relational and logical operators
Operators produce a boolean value, they include:
- Relational operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`. [question:: how is the execution of the logical, r-l? or l-r] [question:: if the right hand is true in false, the evaluation stops there?] [question:: do both expressions are evaluated? Or which one is evaluated first]

```c#
int age = 32;
bool test = age == 32; 
```
