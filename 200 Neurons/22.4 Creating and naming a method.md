## Naming a method
- Methods must use snake_case.
- I can use numbers and these special characters (`_ ! ? =`) **if needed**. They both can only appear at the end of the name. 
- The name must start with a lower-case character because names that start with capital letters are either constants or classes.
- Predicates have a question mark `?` as the last character like `Array#empty?` or `Hash#has_key?`. Predicates usually return booleans, but they also can return nil or other classes. For example,  `File::size?` returns nil if the file does not exist, the size of the file as an Integer otherwise.
- [[22.4 Mutator methods (!)|Mutator methods]] mutate an object usually have an exclamation mark but this is not always the case.
- The method can't have any of the [Ruby reserved words](http://www.java2s.com/Code/Ruby/Language-Basics/Rubysreservedwords.htm).
