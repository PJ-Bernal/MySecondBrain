# About destructive actions
From REST poc, a resource is just a resource, meaning, sending a delete request to authors will delete the authors (the resource) but subsequentially the courses. This is allow, but is not recommended. 

So, methods that implement destructive actions like deleting collections of resources is not a good idea.
