In this example, not all the arrange statements are the same for all test, but have something in common. 
# Creating a directory
Create a directory for the class fixtures, and a class that will be the class fixture of the testing class, in whose constructor are the dependencies required by the test.

For that create read only properties so test can get the instances via property wrappers, but they can't set the properties to new instances. Also, implement the i disposible interface.

# Adding the fixture to the test
The og code.

First, implement the `IClassFixture` interface passing the type of fixture created in the class fixture.

Now, thanks to the interface implementation, an instance of the type passed to the interface will be instantiated right before the first test run. 
## Add a constructor to the test class

## Inject the instance of the fixture
The og code.

And now through the instance call the properties of the fixture class.

Do this for all test, some test will need an employee management test data repo, other the empoyee service, other both like above.

# Testing
This example use a thread to add 3 seconds when creating an instance of employee, without the fixture, all test took 24 seconds.

After the fixture only 15ms
