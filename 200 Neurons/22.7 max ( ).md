[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

The same as `min ( )` but select the largest possible value. 

>You can think of max() as ensuring a minimum allowed value for a property.

```CSS
width: max(100px, 4em, 50%);
```

As long as 4em or 50% result in lengths longer than 100px, max() will select (the bigger) one of them. If they are smaller than 100px (maybe as a cause of user’s font size preferences, or their browser’s window size or zoom level), then 100px will win out as the largest. You can think of 100px in this example as a guard value: width here won’t ever be set to less than 100px.

The max function is most useful when the viewing window is either exceptionally small, or the user increases the content size by using the browser’s zoom feature.
