# About database fields and class fields/properties
What is returned or accepted by the API is not the same as the entities in the db.

For example, a `PersonDto` class could have a full name property which concatenates first name and last name database fields. Those fields are not saved as such in a database. They are calculated on the go and won't be part of the person class. 
# Adding a model
Model classes should be data transfer object classes, for example, `CityDto`.

- Some properties can be initialize to null, like Name.
- Use nullable reference types `?` to explicit indicate that a property can be null.
