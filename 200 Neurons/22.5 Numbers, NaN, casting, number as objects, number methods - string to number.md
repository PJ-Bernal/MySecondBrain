[[12.5 Javascript|Javascript]]

JS doesn’t define different numbers like integers, short, etc. There are only two types: Number and BigInt. Numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers, store in 64 bits. 
## Adding numbers and strings
Addition operator is use for both addition and string concatenation (between two strings or a string and a number). To better understand the following scenarios, remember the JS interpreter works from left to right. 

>[!info]
>1. Several number operands before the string: first number addition, then string concatenation. 
>2. String followed by several numbers, or, one number followed by a string. The number is casted to string, and the concatenation takes place. 
>```JS
>let x = 10, y = 20, z = “30”;
>let result = x + y + z; // output: 3030. Literal operator happen first, then the concatenation. 
>
>let x = 10, y = 20;
>let result = "The result is: " + y + z; // output: The result is 1020
>
>let x= 10, z = “30”;
>let result = x + z; // Output: 1030
>let result = z + x; // Output: 3010
>```
### Numeric string casting
JS will try to convert strings to number in all numeric operations, but addition (as it works as concatenation). 

>[!example]
>```JS
>let x = “100”, y = “20”;
>let z = x / y; // Output: 5
>let z = x + y; // Output: 10020
>```
## NaN, not a number

>[!multi-column]

>NaN represents an error incorrect or undefined mathematical operation is performed.
>```JS
let result = 0 / 0; // NaN
let result2 = Math.sqrt(-1); // NaN

>[!multi-column]
>
>JS will coerce automatically string numbers. If this coercion fails, then NaN appears.
>```JS
let result = 0 / 0; // NaN
let result2 = Math.sqrt(-1); // NaN

>[!multi-column]
>
>Any further operation using a NaN returns NaN, with one exception.
>```JS
>NaN ** 0; // 1

>[!multi-column]
>
>>The ‘isNaN()’ function return true if the parameter is a NaN. This means, **JS recognize NaN as a number** (`typeof NaN`Output: number)
>```JS
>let z = 100 / “apple”; output: NaN.
>isNaN(z) //Output: true
>let z = 100 / “10”;// Output: 10


>[!multi-column]
>
>Using NaN in an operation can result in NaN or a concatenation.
>```JS
>let x = NaN, y = 5;
>let z = x + y; // Output: NaN
>let x = NaN, y = “5”;
>let z = x + y; // Output: NaN5

## Numbers as objects

>[!multi-column]
>
>Number is a primitive value, though, it can be turned into an object. However, doing this isn't recommended.
>```JS
let y = new Number(123);

>[!multi-column]
>
>There are some differences between strict and loose comparison.
>```JS
>let x = 500, y = new Number (500); 
>console.log(x==y) //Output: true
>console.log(x===y) //Output: false 

## Useful number methods
>[!info] toFixed()
>To round a number to a fixed number of decimal places.
>```JS
>const lotsOfDecimal = 1.766584958675746364;
>const twoDecimalPlaces = lotsOfDecimal.toFixed(2);
>twoDecimalPlaces; // Output: 1.77
>```
### Converting string to number
There are two main ways to convert a string into a number.
#### Number function
>[!example]
>```JS
>let x = “20”;
>x = Number(x); 
>console.log(x + 10); // Output: 30
>```
#### Plus operator
Doing this don’t have any impact on numbers.

>[!example]
>```JS
>let x = 1;
>alert( +x ); // Output: 1
>alert(+'5' + 5); //Output: 10
>alert(+''); // 0 
> let apples = "2";
>let oranges = "3";
>alert( +apples + +oranges ); // 5
>```

The last line works because the unary plus operator has a higher [[22.5 Operands - operators -  expressions - chaining assignments#Operator precedence|precedence]] than the addition, thus the conversion is done first and then the addition.
