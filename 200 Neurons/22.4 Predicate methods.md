[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Methods that have a question mark at the end and generally return a boolean value; some exceptions like `File::size?` returns nil if the file does not exist, the size of the file as an Integer otherwise.

```ruby
puts 5.even?  #=> false
puts 6.even?  #=> true
puts 17.odd?  #=> true

puts 12.between?(10, 15)  #=> true
```

>[!info]
>However there is no rule for this methods will return a boolean, for convention and readability they should do it.
