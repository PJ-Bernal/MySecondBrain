[[13.7 C Sharp|C#]]

Implicit typing allow C# to inferr the type of a variable, appending the var keyword to the variable identifier, based on what is the expression on the declaration statement. `var a = 123`; not `var int a = 123;` If there is no declaration statement, then, the app wont compile, for example: `var employeeAge;`. 
 
The variable sill gets attached to a type, and its decided on compile time (before the app runs). Once the compiler attached a type, it cant be changed. 

Overuse implicit typing can make the code a less readable.

In some cases, for example when using LINQ, the use of var is required.
