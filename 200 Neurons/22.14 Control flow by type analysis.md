[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

TS can infer which type I want to use for a code branch depending on the control flow using the `typeof` operand.

For example, inside the if, is aware of all types the variable is holding at that moment. However, once inside of the code branch, TS infer based on the if conditional, the type is a string, and then, in the else, a number.

If my variable holds more types, then more ifs are require, and the type the code don't check will go to the else branch. 

This TS feature is know as type narrowing.
