[[12.12 React|React]]

As a general rule of thumb: donâ€™t put values in state that can be calculated using existing values, state, and/or props.

## State should not be mutated
State can be change in a hard-coded way, however, only the `setState` function should be use to change the state. If `state` needs to change. Primitives are immutable but arrays and objects are mutable, however, I should never mutate them but create a copy.

```jsx
function Person() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({ name: "John", age: 100 });

  // BAD - Don't do this!
  const handleIncreaseAge = () => {
    // mutating the current state object
    person.age = person.age + 1;
    setPerson(person);
  };

  // GOOD - Do this!
  const handleIncreaseAge = () => {
    // copy the existing person object into a new object
    // while updating the age property
    const newPerson = { ...person, age: person.age + 1 };
    setPerson(newPerson);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{person.name}</h1>
      <h2>{person.age}</h2>
      <button onClick={handleIncreaseAge}>Increase age</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

In the case of a primitive, use `setState` directly like `setState(<new number>)`. 

React uses the `Object.is()` method to check if the object passed to `setState` is the same as the object passed in `useState` or the state of the previous rendering. If the object is modify on the fly, the same object is being passed, that's why a copy is required. 

## How state updates
[[22.5 What are closures - same name variables and different lexical scopes - functions as return value|Closures]] are created when a function is invoked another function. All components are functions and generally, the event handlers are written in functions as well. Thus, the event handler `handleIncreaseAge` creates a closure capturing the value of `index`.

The `setState()` will **never** return the state value, neither using a regular call or an arrow function. 

```jsx
export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0); // 1
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);
//   console.log(`this is show more: ${showMore}`);
  if(index == 0) {
    console.log(`this is original index: ${index}`)
  } else {
      console.log(`New render index: ${index}`)
  }

  function sayHi() {
    console.log('Hi"')
  }

  sayHi();

  function handleNextClick() {
    console.log(`Before any index: ${index}`)
    setIndex(thisCatchsIndex => {
      console.log(`This is index inside of first set --> ${thisCatchsIndex}`);
      return thisCatchsIndex + 1;
      }
    );

    console.log(`After first index: ${index} `);

    setIndex(thisCatchsTheFirstSet => {
      console.log(`This is index inside of second set --> ${thisCatchsTheFirstSet}`);
      return thisCatchsTheFirstSet + 1;
      }
    );

    console.log(`After second index: ${index}`);

    setIndex(thisCatchsThethirdSet => {
        console.log(`This is index inside of third set --> ${thisCatchsThethirdSet}`);
        return thisCatchsThethirdSet + 1
        }
      );

    console.log(`Last index: ${index}`);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details
      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

The component render for the first time, executing all function calls within the function implementation.

Once the event is triggered, the event function executes from top to bottom. The `setState()` function creates a closure, so any function inside of `handleNextClick` will grab the `index` value created here `// 1`.

If the expression inside of `setState()` is not a function, then each `setState()` call will grab the closure function, 0 in this example. Is like saying: r**replace** the current render with an increase in index by 1. Then, **replace** (replace the replace) the current render with an increase in index by 1.

If the expression inside is a function (like in this example), then, the first `setState()` grab the value given for the closure, and subsequent `setState()` will grab the return value of the above `setState()`. 

Also, detail `setState()` functions are not executed in the order they were coded. Once the parser reaches the first `setState()`, and moves to the `setState()`, it will execute those at the end. Detail the internal consoles are output both almost at the end of the console.

Because the state change, a new re-render happens but this time with the new value of 3. 

When you call setState (or the setter function from useState), you're essentially telling React: "Hey, I want to update this state for the next render."

>[!important]
>React don't re-render the component when multiple `setState()` functions are called using a function, React batches several set state calls and make only one render.
