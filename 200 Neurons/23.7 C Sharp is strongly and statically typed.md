With compiler inference. Thus, the type of return values, arguments, local variables, etc. Must be declared  explicitly.

This prevents errors in compile and run time. 



## Compiler inference
To indicate the compiler to infer the data type of something, add `var` as the data type.

Compiler inference is more powerful when inferencing custom types, created using generics. 

## Check data types in runtime
Check the locals window to see the data type of a current variable. Or use the immediate window to get the data type name using `<data name>.GetType().FullName`, hit enter.
