This note is about how to create a reusable page list class for paging, to gather all properties to create the meatadata.

Add a new class to the helpers folder, derived from `List<T>`, to have additional functionality on the class.

At least, I need the total amount of pages, the current page, size and total amount of items.

Then, calculate if there are previous or an additional pages.

In the constructor, add range is a method of list T, that adds all the items to the list.

Then create a static method that will create that paged list, the constructor is not being called directly, this is to encapsulate the logic of the constructor logic (this is a factory pattern), all casting and calculations are done in this method, rather than having to do that in the constructor. 

The first parameter of this method is an `IQueryable` that is what I get after applying the where clauses in the repo.

The constructor needs the total amount of items and the correct paged items. So, first, use count on the source. Then get the actual page of items. Then call the constructor.

Finally, update the repo interface.

And change the action method signature return type.

And update its return value.
