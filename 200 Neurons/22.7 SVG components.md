[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

Generally, I'll copy some code from Figma or Adobe Illustrator SVG file to starts my own SVG image, or just copy some code from the internet and then adjust it to my needs. The major parts of a SVG image are the following:

```HTML
<div class="container">
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
    <rect x=0 y=0 width=100 height=100 fill="burlywood"/>
    <path d="M 10 10 H 90 V 90 L 10 60" fill="transparent" stroke="black" stroke-width="3"/>
  <circle cx=50 cy=50 r=20 class="svg-circle"/>
    <g class="svg-text-group">
      <text x="20" y="25" rotate="10" id="hello-text">Hello!</text>
      <use href="#hello-text" x="-10" y="65" fill="white"/>
    </g>
</svg>
</div>
```

## xmlns
Stands for 'XML NameSpace' and define the namespace that the SVG elements belong to by ensuring the element is recognized as part of the SVG specification and not as a custom or unknown XML elements. For SVG, the namespace URI is `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg`. Without it, some browsers won't render or render incorrectly the image.

## viewBox
Define the bounds of the SVG. When you have to define the positions of different points of the elements in your SVG, this is what thatâ€™s referencing. It also defines the aspect ratio and the origin of your SVG. The viewBox fields are in charge of provide a correct and high quality scalability of the image, also to hide part of the image (useful for animations).

>One important concept is the viewport, this is the portion of the image that I see. You can think of the viewport as the window to our image and the viewBox as the tool we use to scale and position the image.

>In the following example, the viewport matches the viewBox perfectly, `viewBox="0 0 100 100`.

>Now I can alter the viewport with the last two values, `viewBox="0 0 75 75`. Doing this will 'zoom in' the image.

To crop images I can use the first to values, think of them as 'from which point' my viewport will be rendering the image. `vieBox=""50 0 100 100"`

## class, id
These attributes are the same as in HTML so I can target the SVG with CSS and JS; or to re-use an SVG element using `use`.

```HTML
<svg viewBox="0 0 30 10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <circle id="myCircle" cx="5" cy="5" r="4" stroke="blue" />
  <use href="#myCircle" x="10" fill="blue" />
  <use href="#myCircle" x="20" fill="white" stroke="red" />
</svg>
```

## circle, rect, path, text
These are the basic SVG building SVG blocks to build images, though there are many more. They are defined thanks to the SVG namespace. [This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element) is the complete list of building blocks. 
## fill, stroke...
They are some of the elements, attributes and properties that SVG has, but only certain can be used within CSS. For example, `fill` will change the element color. I can use a default color `fill="white"` or use `fill="currentColor"` to let the color change dynamically.
