[[13.8 ASP.NET Core|.NET]]

# Prior to ASP.NET Core
ASP.NET and .NET Core were the predecessors of ASP.NET Core, where closed to the Windows OS. Now, ASP:NET Core and .NET is cross-platform now, the same code base can run in any OS without make any changes. 

ASP.NET Core is modular, in fact, is a collection of a large set of NuGet packages, so I can choose only what I want to use. This is a big shift from previous version, when creating a ASP.NET app involve to include the whole framework in the app. 

The latter is useful for memory management, especially when creating microservices where a single functionality is exposed. Therefore, building and hosting these require a platform that is highly scalable, this is possible thanks to ASP.NET Core.
