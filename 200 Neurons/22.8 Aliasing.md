[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

This is the transaction file.

Imagine an scenario in which I have create an object from both Transaction classes; the stripe and paddle. 

If I make two imports from the name spaces, this triggers an error because I'm importing two transaction classes that have the same name, so PHP doesn't know which one to use.

so I can alias the classes using `as`.

## Use cases
- To deal with long class names.
- Inside a namespace, using a package or library that also has a class with the same name as one of my classes.

Aliasing solve that, where vendor is the name of the package or the author of the library.

In the above example I have another transaction class so this is an example of how to use aliasing.
