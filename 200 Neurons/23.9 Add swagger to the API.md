[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

The `ASP.NET Core Web API` template automatically incudes a reference to the swashbuckler library, to confirm this go to dependencies and packages, or install swashbuckle.aspnetcore. 
# Adding the service
These two services are automatically added, if not, add those: 
- `AddEndpointsApiExplorer`: ASP.NET Core service that expose information on the API, like the available endpoints and how to interact with them. Use by swashbuckler to generate the Open API specification. 
-	`AddswaggerGen`: register services used for effectively generate the OpenAPI specification.

Both services are combines to expose an OpenAPI specification.

# Adding the middleware

Then, after the app has been build add: 

`UseSwagger`: ensures the middleware for generating the OpenAPI specification is added. Simply init swagger. 

`UseSwaggerUI`: ensures that the middleware that use that specification generate the default swagger UI documentation. This interprets the open api specification to build a documentation UI. 


The combination of add swagger, add swagger gen and swagger UI is what shashbuckle is made of. 





>[!important]
>- To be explicit, is better to configure the swagger UI middleware using the swagger endpoint method, passing the endpoint where the open api specification is and a name for the UI.
>- Also, if I want, I can make the swagger UI the defaul when someone is looking at the API, instead of going to /swagger. To do that, add the route prefix.

Then, navigate to /swagger to see the UI.

# The default swagger UI 
By default, everything that is not part of v1 is missing. However, all the version 1 endpoints, the DTOs (models), and the entities returned by the API should be there. Detail Below the api name is the link to the open api specification. 

This UI is created from the open API specification.

# About the documented class models in Swagger UI
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20250203083350.png]]

When a class model is documented, swashbuckle looks at the variable types and data annotations attributes of the model properties. 

For example, name and description of poidto are nullable. Also, when creating a poi the name is required *
