[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

The `ASP.NET Core Web API` template automatically incudes a reference to the swashbuckler library, to confirm this go to dependencies and packages, or install swashbuckle.aspnetcore. 
# Adding the service
Register the services:
- `AddEndpointsApiExplorer`: ASP.NET Core service that expose information on the API, like the available endpoints and how to interact with them. Use by swashbuckler to generate the Open API specification. 
-	`AddswaggerGen`: register services used for effectively generate the OpenAPI specification.

# Adding the middleware

Then, after the app has been build add: 

`UseSwagger`: ensures the middleware for generating the OpenAPI specification is added. Simply init swagger. 

`UseSwaggerUI`: ensures that the middleware that use that specification generate the default swagger UI documentation. 












# The default swagger UI 
By default, everything that is not part of v1 is missing. However, all the version 1 endpoints, the DTOs (models), and the entities returned by the API should be there.

# Return types and swagger
All action methods in the controllers will appear in the swagger UI, regardless if they use `ActionResult`, `IActionResult` or a specific type. However, the return type affects HOW the response is documented (not whether the endpoint itself appears in the documentation)

-	`ActionResult<T>`: the endpoint’s return type is strong-type, hence, swagger is able to include in the documentation. 
-	`IActionResult`: the endpoint's return type is flexible, it returns several types. Swagger is not able to infer the exact response and the use of an attribute could be required, `[ProduceResponseType(StatusCodes.Status200OK, Type = typeof(CityDto))]`
-	Return a specific type like `<CityDto>` swagger infers the response type and is included in the documentation. 

>[!important]
>- If the action method is async and the method is wrapped in a task, that doesn’t affect the described above.   
>- When Shawsbuckle is able to identify the return type of an endpoint, because is returning a specific type or the action method is using `ActionResult`, then, the endpoint and the class model the action method return will be documented. If the endpoint is using `IActionResult`, shawsbuckle can’t identify the return type, therefore, NOT ALL responses will be documented, and the class model that action result returns won’t.

# About the documented class models in Swagger UI
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20250203083350.png]]

When a class model is documented, swashbuckle looks at the variable types and data annotations attributes of the model properties. 

For example, name and description of poidto are nullable. Also, when creating a poi the name is required *
