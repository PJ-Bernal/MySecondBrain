Custom attributes are created when the built-in validation attributes don't provide the type of validation needed. They are created for properties inside of the class, but can also be for class level validation.

Add a new folder, named validation attributes, with the class. Then, to enable the attribute in the automated validation process, make it derived from the validation attribute.

Then override the method that gives access to the validation context

if the title isn't the same as the description, the validation for that rules was successful.

Then, inside of the dto, then, applu the validation attribute.

# Test
The class has the validation commented, so the error shown comes from the validation attribute of the class.

The result is the same as when using the i validatable object. So why use custom attributes instead of implementing the i validatable object.

Because custom attributes get executed before the validate method gets called, which is useful for property level validation.
