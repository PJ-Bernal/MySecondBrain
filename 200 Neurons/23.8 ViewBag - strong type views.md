To access controller data, use `@ViewBag` to give the view access to the view bag object, which will be evaluated. 

The `@` indicate the following is ASP.NET Core code, regular C# code.

The view bag is a dynamic object, is not use that often. Most views should be strongly-.typed views.

The data passed using a field (that has been instantiated with a constructor using DI) to a view is called the data model property, and the data called in the controller is return behind the scenes to the view.

To create a strong-type view, include at the top the type of the object that is going to be passed in, with the `@model` keyword of Razor.
