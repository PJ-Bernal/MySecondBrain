# To do
Join this note with the other one that have similar infomation, is under the same topic of text styles.

Fonts with no styles will be styled through the [[22.7 What are default settings and user-agent|user-agent stylesheet]] that vary from browser to browser. Typography is more than choosing a good font, but make it attractive.

## Scaling text
A more responsive approach fro above is to let the user's device width influence the text size, with the `vw` unit, that let the text grow or shrink in proportion to the browser width. To make this work I have to mix the vw unit with what ever relative unit (em, rem or ch).

```css
html {
  font-size: 2.5vw; /*I can't use vw by itself in a font-size declaration*/
}
```

Here I use the relative units using the `calc()` function:

```css
html {
  font-size: calc(0.75rem + 1.5vw);
}
```

I can't predict the text size with this method, but at least the text size will be changing dynamically. Additionally, there is a possibility of getting 'extreme values' for small on narrow screens and too big on wide screens. [This](https://web.dev/static/learn/design/typography/video/KT4TDYaWOHYfN59zz6Rc0X4k4MH3/x5h7TqkGHJIPa61wPvAs.mp4) is what calc does. 

## Clamping text
To control those 'extreme' values, I can use `clamp()` that takes three arguments: the minimum size, the condition (same as used in `calc()`, and the maximum size. 

```css
html {
  font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.75rem + 1.5vw, 2rem);
}
```

With the above ruleset grants the text size will never go below 1rem or above 2 rem. Detail the difference now from using clamp [here](https://web.dev/static/learn/design/typography/video/KT4TDYaWOHYfN59zz6Rc0X4k4MH3/vVwP2L0z90zXL28iPYL4.mp4). 

## Line length
There isn't a `line-length` property in CSS, but the `max-inline-size` property stop the text from getting too wide. Don't use an absolute unit (px) as value, better to use a relative unit (rem or ch) to allow the user to scale up or down the font so the line length change dynamically.

This ruleset with `ch` units will make new lines to wrap at the 66th character at that font size. Remember, the character must be between 45 and 75. [Here is the video](https://web.dev/static/learn/design/typography/video/KT4TDYaWOHYfN59zz6Rc0X4k4MH3/9Nxi6HuU28aQhxtzXq7l.mp4).

```css
article {
  max-inline-size: 66ch;
}
```

## Line height
This property is relative to the font-size, so is XX the font-size value. The recommended standard is 1.5. By default is 1.2

```css
html {
  font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.75rem + 1.5vw, 2rem);
}
article {
  margin: auto;
  max-inline-size: 66ch;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

[Another approach](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/css-techniques-legibility/#optimal-line-height) suggest to use the unit `ex`, that refers to the height of the letter x, to give a bit more line height that using 1.5. Consider use this in the [[22.7 The best reset - normalization|normalization]].  

```css
p {
    line-height: calc(1ex / 0.32);
}
```
