[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

PHP will cache the return values of some of the file related functions for better performance. [This](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.clearstatcache.php) is the list of cacheable functions. 

Right now the file exists, but has nothing on it, so its size is 0.

In this case, the `file_put_contents()` function embed within the file the given parameter. Running the script again, prints 00, this is because the result of the file size function was cached (even though the file size is no longer zero), so when is called again, is printing the previous result.

Use `clearstatcache()` to clear cache. For this new example the foo file has nothing, the file size prints 0, then something is added, the cache is clear, and the file now is 11.
