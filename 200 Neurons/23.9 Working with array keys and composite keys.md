Array key = 1, 2, 3. Composite key: key1 = value1, key2= value2.

When creating a location header, an array key is require, for creating a collection of resources.

# Created the key
Write the keys next to the method argument in parenthesis. In this, they keys are the author ids of the collection.

The actual route has binding when working with simple types like strings or ints, when the route use `{authorId}`, etc. But there's no route for array keys. 

One approach is to take an IEnum of string and cast it, but is better to use a custom model binder that will need the From Route attribute (by default, it looks at the body for collection items).

# Creating the model binder
Add a class to the helpers folder.

![[Pasted image 20250204140324.png]]

The model binding context contains information about binding.

First, ensure the model binder only works on enum types, by checking the model metadata on binding context.

![[Pasted image 20250204140444.png]]

To get the inputted value, use a Value Provider and call get value.

![[Pasted image 20250204140558.png]]

If the value is null or whitespace, set the model binding result to null. 

![[Pasted image 20250204140626.png]]

If the value is not null, check the enums type, using get type info. Then convert the items in the value list to the enum type using get converter. 

![[Pasted image 20250204140735.png]]

Then convert each item in the value list to the enum type. What this is doing is taking each piece of string that was inputted via URL, and try to convert that into a GuID from that string. 

![[Pasted image 20250204140843.png]]

If the conversion was successful, create an array type, setting the model value on the binding context. 

![[Pasted image 20250204141011.png]]

Then return.

# Use the model binder
In the controller, use the binder to bind the Authors ids from the URI, to the IEnum of Guid. Do that with the model binder attribute, passing the type of array model binder.

# Method implementation
First, get the matching author from the data store via the repo with the get authors async, the check is whether all authors have been found.

![[Pasted image 20250204141349.png]]

Finally map the entities to AuthodDtos, and return ok.

![[Pasted image 20250204141414.png]]

I need this action method to have a name to be able to refer that when using the Create At Route when creating mnultiple resources at once.

# Inside of the post method for creating multiple authors
The og code.

![[Pasted image 20250204141542.png]]

First, create the content for the response body, which is an IEnum of Author Dto. 

![[Pasted image 20250204141628.png]]

Then bring the list of ids. Use Join. 

![[Pasted image 20250204141707.png]]

Finally use the create at route method

![[Pasted image 20250204141729.png]]

# Testing
![[Pasted image 20250204141806.png]]


See the response 201, and the response body containing the two authors.
![[Pasted image 20250204141824.png]]

The location headers contain a key with two GuIDs of the newly created authors. 


![[Pasted image 20250204141905.png]]

If I navigate to that using a get I should be able to see both authors.
