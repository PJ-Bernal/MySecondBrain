The empty template create a solution, a project which contains: 

-	Connected services: allow to reference other services. 
-	Dependencies: list all references for the project, for example, the NuGet packages. [[23.8 The CSProj file#References to packages|Remember]] there are two packages by default. 
-	Properties: contains a JSON file called launchsettings.json used when running the app.
-	Program.cs: code base generated in the project's root. This is the default entry port of the app. 
-	Appsettings.json: store configuration information. Like adding the connection to a database, the connection string.

-	Program.cs: again this file is generated in the root of the project. 
-	Wwwroot directory.
-	Properties: contains the launchsettings.json is a configuration file about how to start the app when using it from VS. Is a dev only file. It contains profiles to run the app, for example, with or without IS.
