TS infer the item input as element, not to an HTML element.

So, use generic syntax. `addEventListener` is a method of the EventTarget interface that is implemented by all nodes, that's why I don't need to cast add button to use the add event listener.

# Remove a node

When a function is triggered by something. e.target grabs the element that creates the event, button, etc.

Sometines TS can infer the type of e, specially in add event listeners, in this case it knows because the event is keyup.
