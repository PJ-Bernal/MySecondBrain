[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

>[!multi-column]
>
>Some errors stop the script execution (fatal errors) and some not (warnings). PHP decides what errors report based on the error configuration within `php.ini`, or using the `error_reporting()` within the script with the following values:
>
>- 0: no errors are reported.
>- E_ALL: all errors are reported. 
>%% %%
>>Is recommended `E_ALL` for production and development (specially here) to catch errors early on.

## Levels of reporting
Levels of reporting can change using predefined constants [here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php). 
## Triggering errors manually
>[!multi-column]
>
>Only the `E_USER_` errors, for example `E_USER_ERROR` or `E_USER_WARNING`, can be trigger manually using the `trigger_errror()` function. For example here a warning is being triggered.

>Not using a `E_USER_` constant when triggering an error will cause a fatal error and the script will stop executing.

## Display error
Error display is handled by the `display_errors` directive; when off, the errors are hide from the user and log (if the directive is turn on). 

Use the `error_log()` function to log errors manually. 

The location of the log, in XAMPP, is located in the apache row, logs, and php error log. 
## Handle errors
PHP allows to create a custom error handler to tell PHP how to handle errors at runtime (for example I can customize to clean something when an error happens). 

### Creating a custom error handler
First, create user defined function with two parameters, error type (int) and error message (string). Additional parameters are the file and line number where the error happen. 

>[!important]
>In production, not development, printing the error message is **not** recommended because what is the reason to have a custom handler if just prints the error, this solves nothing. 

This is an example of a user defined error handler function, here the exit is used, but I can write return if I want the script to continue.

### How to register the error function 
Use `set_error_handler()`, whose first argument is the error handler function and the second is the error level.  

>[!important]
This set error handler will override what I have set for error reporting. In this case, the custom error will override the `error_reporting(E_ALL $ ~E_WARNING)`.

>Here for example my error reporting includes all errors but warnings, that's why though x hasn't been defined, nothing appears in the browser.

>Now detail in the error reporting I don't want to see any warning, but the set error handler is overwriting that directive, so is showing the return of the error function, including the error message, the line and file.

## Parse errors
Some errors can be handle by parse and compilers, but the error handler function. 


![[Pasted image 20240310135649.png|center|500]]

In this example, the last line is missing a ; and the error handler function IS NOT reporting this error, is the parser. 

If the error happens before the set_error_handler function is set, that error won't be handled by the custom error handler. 

## Restore error handler
Use the restore_error_handler to go back to default handled by PHP.

```PHP
function custom_error_handler($errno, 
$errstr, $errfile, $errline) {
    echo "Error: $errstr\n";
}
set_error_handler('custom_error_handler');
echo $age ;
 
// Restore the default error handler
restore_error_handler();
 
// Generate another error
echo $access_granted ;
```

![[Pasted image 20240410095055.png]]

Both variables are not declared, but the first echo is affected by the error handler function. Once the error handler is restored, PHP handled the errors as defined in the php.ini file.
