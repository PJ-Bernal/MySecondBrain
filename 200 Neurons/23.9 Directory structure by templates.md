When creating a project using a template, some directories and files are particular to the project type while other always get generated.

An empty template create a solution whose project which contains: 

-	Connected services: allow to reference other services. 
-	Dependencies: list all references for the project, for example, the NuGet packages. [[23.9 The CSProj file#References to packages|Remember]] there are two packages by default, but more could be added by other templates. 
-	Properties: contains a JSON file called `launchsettings.json` used when running the app.
-	Program.cs: code base generated in the project's root. This is the default entry port of the app. 
-	Appsettings.json: store configuration information. Like adding the connection to a database, the connection string, secrets, etc.

Template that complements the empty template, including directories and sample code for models, views and controllers. Hence, the MVC pattern is already applied using the template. 

The MVC template includes:
-	Program.cs: again this file is generated in the root of the project. 
-	Wwwroot directory.
-	Properties: contains the launchsettings.json is a configuration file about how to start the app when using it from VS. Is a dev only file. It contains profiles to run the app, for example, with or without IS.
