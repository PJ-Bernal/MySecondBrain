[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

## What happen a variable is reassigned?
Detail jerry still points at the object tom used to refer.

```ruby
tom = "kitty"
jerry = tom
tom = "mouse"

puts tom   
#=> mouse

puts jerry   
#=> "kitty"
```

When one of those variables is reassigned to a different object, this does not change what the other variable refers to:

```ruby
tom = "kitty"
jerry = tom
tom = tom + "kat" #  or tom += "kat"
puts jerry   
#=> "kitty"
```
