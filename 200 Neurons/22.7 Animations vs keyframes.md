[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

Animations use keyframes.

- Transitions animate from one state to another, though they can loop, they weren't designed for that. Animations were designed to enable looping.
- Transitions need a trigger (such a hover or focus pseudo-class, or adding/removing classes via JS). Animations **don't** need a trigger they start when I told them to.
- Animations are flexible in terms of timing. On the other hand, transitions have some values like ease, or the cubic-bezier function, they are 'fixed time' values.

Both have their own use-cases and use keyframes is not always the key to animate something.

A keyframe animation interpolates between different chunks of CSS; they should be reusable. 

## Override properties
While the animation is running, the declarations in the keyframes statement overrule any of the common styles of in the element. 

In this example the background is never red. 

```css
#ball {
  background-color: red;
  animation-duration: 2s;
  animation-name: change-color;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-direction: alternate;
}

@keyframes change-color {
  from {
    background-color: black;
  }
  to {
    background-color: green;
  }
}
```
