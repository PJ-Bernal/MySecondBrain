# Register the authentication scheme
Authentication schemes are registered services in `Program.cs` through `AddAuthentication()`. Inside I can specify the default authentication, challenge and default scheme. This example only uses bearer token authentication. 

```c#
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(x =>
{
    x.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    x.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    x.DefaultScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
```

Or use a simply version, in which the `DefaultScheme` is set to `JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme`

```c#
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
```

If the API is gong to be consumed by a web app and another API I can use this set up.

```c#
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =>
{
    options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme; // Fallback for other scenarios
})
```
# Configure the scheme
After adding the scheme, append the extension method `AddJwtBearer()` to configure the authentication method.

One method overload allow to specify the scheme and the configuration as method arguments. [One option for the second argument is the ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer.jwtbeareroptions?view=aspnetcore-9.0)`TokenValidationParameters`, this is mandator with a minimum configuration of: ValidateIssuer, ValidateAudience, ValidateLifetime, ValidateIssuerSigningKey,  ValidIssuer, ValidAudience, IssuerSigningKey. 

Also, add the `Authority`(URL of the provider) to indicate the API will only accepts tokens created by that provider.

```c#
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
  .AddJwtBearer(options => 
  {
    options.Authority = "https//localhost:5001";
    options.TokenValidationParameters = new () 
    {
      ValidTypes = new [] { "at+jwt" }
      ValidateAudience = false,
    }
  })
```

### About audience checks
Verify if the token came from a provider is not enough, verify if the receive token is meant to be use for that particular API is also required, using the `audience` claim.

This is a property in the token that contains the name of the API is meant for. The jwt bearer configuration check if that claim contains the name of my API. 

>[!important]
>However, the audience is not part of the OAuth 2 standard. Instead, implement an authorizatin policy. 

I can use the `Audience` in the `JwtBearerOptions` if I have a single audience, or inside of the token validation parameters if I have multiple audience. In this case I have a single one, that's why is on the jwt bearer configuration. 

### About type checks
That option checks the API only accepts Jwt tokens. `at+jwt` means an access token in the JSON web token format. 

# Creating a filter to implement authentication in the controllers
I can use the `Authorize` attribute (for more explicit control in each action method) or implement a global filter.

The filter is added globally to all controllers and action methods, therefore, **every** endpoint will require authentication by default, unless explicitly overridden using the `[AllowAnonymous]` attribute for public endpoints. 

Now, in the controllers add the required attributes, either the anonymous if the endpoint is public or the produces response type if not. This example is applying the filter over controller level so all endpoints require authentication.

# Add oauth tokens to swagger
Add a security definition and requirement.

The definition specify the type of token, OAuth2, whose flow will need the token URI which must point to the token endpoint of the identity provider, then define the scopes with some name. 

The security requirement make sure the token will be included in the header when a request with swagger is done. 

![[Pasted image 20250225122837.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250225123317.png]]

After that swagger will implement an authorize button.

![[Pasted image 20250225123408.png]]

Then make the request, and now the access token is included in the Authorization request header.
