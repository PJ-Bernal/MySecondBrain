[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

# Relative imports
Relative imports direct the compiler to a specific location on the file system where the module can be found. All reference begin with `.`, `./`, `/` or `../`

In thie first example, the compiler will look in the root of the file system. File extension is not necessary as the compiler will look only for ts extensions.

# Non-relative imports
They don't include any reference to the directory structure, no paths.

# When to use which
- Reference: when importing my own modules.
- Non-reference: when importing third-party modules, from libraries for example.
