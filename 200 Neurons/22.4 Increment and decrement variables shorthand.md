[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

To increment and decrement a variable I can:

 ```ruby
age = 18
age += 4
# Under the hood this is: age = age + 4

cost = 10 
cost -= 5
```

This can be done with any math operator `*=`, `/=`, etc.

>Using this operators modify the object state, remember [[22.4 Operations don't (usually) alter objects and how to change objects#How to alter an object state|how to alter an object state]].
