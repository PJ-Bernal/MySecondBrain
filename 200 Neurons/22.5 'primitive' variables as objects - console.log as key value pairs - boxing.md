[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

When a variable is created it either holds a primitive value or a reference to an object.

In the second case, a simple `console.dir()` allow to see all the objects' properties. This is already in key value syntax. 



```js
const person = {
  name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
  age: 32,
  bio: function () {
    console.log(`${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years old.`);
  },
};
```

However in the first case, though the variable name holds a primitive value, JS wrap automatically the primitive in an object with the same type as the primitive type, in a process called boxing. Thus, the variable becomes an object, and has access to properties and methods of its primitive type. To see the prototype chain of a primitive check [[22.5 How to access or show inheritance chain of a node|this note]]

In this example, the 'object' created is the type string, therefore, `name` has access to all properties of methods of that Object. 

```js
let name = 'ana';
console.log({name});
