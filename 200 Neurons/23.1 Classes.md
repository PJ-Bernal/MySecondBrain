## About the class
A class (comes first, objects can't be instantiated without classes) is the code template used to create, instantiate, objects (classes aren't objects - this depend on the programming language).

The class provides the attribute definition (data type), **not necessarily** the attribute's values. As well as common attributes and methods for all objects. 

Objects are created via instantiation; thus, every object represents an instance of a class.

[question:: Is there a way to select which attributes or methods get an object when instantiated?]
Objects instantiated from a class can be distributed individually or as part of a library. 
## Attributes
The attributes an object will have must be defined by the class. 

>[!warning]- Access designations
>When an attribute or method is defined as public, other objects can directly access it. Contrary, if when defined as private, only that object can access it. Another is protected, allow access by related objects.}

## Methods
Methods may implement behaviors that are called from other objects (messages) or provide the fundamental, internal behavior of the class (private methods, not accessible for other objects). 

In OO is common to have public methods that objects to inspect and change the value of the object's attributes (like setName() and getName() ). 

>[!warning]
>Access to attributes within an object should be controlled by the object itself, no by other object.

[question:: How a class can implement methods that are call from other objects]
## Messages
Messages are the communication mechanism between objects. Object A invokes a method of Object B, Object A is sending a message to Object B. Object Bâ€™s response is defined by its return value. Only the public methods of ann object can be invoked by another object.
