[[13.4 Linux]]

Abstraction requires organization, thus Linux components are arranged into layers based on where components sit between the user and the hardware; keeping in mind there is a stack of services that underpin user-run processes in Linux.

The next image shows how the user-run processes, called [[22.4 User space|user space]] processes rely on the kernel to access the hardware via the [[22.4 System call interface|system call interface]] or syscall.

This is a simplification of all the stuff the kernel manages.

## Hardware
Includes the disks, and network interfaces, also, the memory and CPUs are in charge of performing computation and reading from and writing to memory.
## [[22.4 What is the kernel]]
![[22.4 What is the kernel#^b7eea8]]
## [[22.4 Process]]
Running programs managed by the kernel that collectively make up the upper layer called user space (it doesn't matter if the user directly interacts with them, e.i. all web servers run as user processes).

>[!warning] 
>^[For a better understanding of the following, check [[22.4 Process|what is a process and a thread.]]]The kernel is located within the memory in a space known as _kernel space,_ it runs in _kernel mode_ (has unrestricted access to the processor and main memory). The user processes run in _user mode_ (has restricted access to a subset of memory and safe CPU operations), and the _user space_ are parts of the memory the user processes can access; if a process crashes, the consequences are limited (based on the process privileges) and cleaned up by the kernel. 
>If a web browser crashes, nothing happens. If the kernel crashes...
