EFC enable testing and test isolation by avoiding calling into a real db, using in-memory implementation instead, isolating the test. There are two approaches when using EFC.

# In memory provider
Good for simple scenarios, not the best option. 
# Using sqlite in-memory mode
This has the best compatibility with a real db. Be mindful this is a SQL db, so using another one could generate some discrepancies. 
## Using sqlite in-memory mode
This is the method for testing, it calls the db. the test will test the last part, the correct bonus recalcualtion.

Create a class for the test, then change the connection string to memory as the data source. First, create a sql lite connection and **open it**.

Then new the employee db context so it'll pass through the repo using the db options, so create those options with options builder, using as a type the employee db context.

Then use the options on options builder as a parameter for the class of the db context to generate an db context instance.

Then, confirm the db has been created and all migrations are executed, using the dbcontext db migrate.

>Calling into the db is expensive, so here the code can rely on a fixture to set up the test.

Then create the repo passing the newly created db context; and newly the employee service.

Up to this point, the db is correctly configured and I have the required instances to start the real arrange of the test. Detailing the method signature it needs a course to attend and an internal employee, so first create those. Then, check if both are null with the if, in case they will return an exception bc the test fail. 

Then, calculate the expected bonus.

Finally the assert and act..
