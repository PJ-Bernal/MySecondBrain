The rotate, scale and translate properties also work for 3D transformations. 


## Rotate a specific axis
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20240926135408.png|center|300]]

Rotates the element according to the image. For the z axis, it not follows the rule of the right hand. 

>[!blank-container|float-right-small]
>```js
>.element {
>  transform: rotateX(10deg);
>  transform: rotateY(-5rad);
>  transform: rotateZ(2turn);
>  transform: rotate3d(2, -1, -1, -0.2turn);
>}
>```

This property doesn't require the `perpective` property to be included in the father container. 

The vanishing axis starts from the middle of the element. So I rotate the container along those 'needles'. When I make one rotation over X, the Y needle also rotates, **keep this in mind**.


## Scale the z or all axis
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```js
>.element {
>  transform: scaleZ(1.4);
>  transform: scale3d(1.2, 1, 1.9);
>}
>```

This property allow to scale the 3D element.




## Perspective
The perspective value determine the intensity of the 3D effect as 'it determines' the distance between the viewer and the object. For example a value of 2000px produce a subtle 3D effect rather than a 200px value. 

Perspective has its own vanishing point that is from which point I'm looking the 3D object. I can change that with the `perspective-origin` [property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/perspective-origin) 
### Property
This property that tells the distance between 'the user' and the plane z of the element. Generally applied to a container to give its children a **share** 3D behavior, having the vanishing point is by default at the center of the element by default. 
>[!blank-container|float-left]

This image shows each children has a share 3D behavior, thus, all of them look different.

>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```css
>.parent.perspective {
>  perspective: 5em;
>}
>
>.child {
>  margin: .5em;
>  width: 3em;
>  height: 3em;
>  background: tomato;
>  display: inline-block;
>  border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.5);
>}
>
>.parent.perspective .child {
>  transform: rotateX(30deg);
>  background: tomato;
>}
>```

Detail the perspective property is allowed to the parent and the children. 

Therefore, each children chain transform property will have a 3d effect on its own. In this example, all div rotate 30Â°, but all look different because the vanishing point is the center of the div container. 

Here, all the elements have **a common** vanishing point. 







### Function
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20240927083953.png|center|200]]

The perspective function must be used within the transform property, it enables the 3D behavior on a single element (when having a container with multiple elements, each one has its own perspective, its own vanishing point). On the contrary, use the property if I want to have **a single** vanishing point to a collection of elements. 

Also, it must be used with other transform properties (to understand this, think about what do the element behave only telling it "hey, you will be having a 3D behavior". The element does nothing). 

Perspective must be declared first (leftmost) when there are multiple transform function values.



```css
.panel--red {
  /* perspective function in transform property */
  transform: perspective(400px) rotateY(45deg);
}
```

## Translate and translateZ()
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```js
>.element {
>  transform: perspective (250px);
>  transform: translateZ(100px);
>  transform: translate3d(42px, -62px, -135px);
>}
>```

**Move** the element along the z or the three dimensional axis. This property **require** the `perspective` property or function either on the father or the element.

`translatez()` alter the appearance of the element. Contrary to [[22.7 Stacking context#z-index|z-index]]. 

### TranslateZ vs z-index

## How to build 3D transforms with the perspective property
1. Add the `perspective` property to the father container with an initial length. Add the  `transfor-style: preserve-3d`, to let the child elements be on a 3D space, rather than [having perspective but stay on the same plane](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-style).
2. Add all the 3D elements to the father elements.
3. Add the `rotateX` and `rotateY`. All of the child 3D elements will be rotate and translated based on their father container. 
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```css
>.w1 {
>  perspective: 1000px;
>  font-size: 4em;
>  width: 2em;
>  margin: 1.5em auto;
>  transform-style: preserve-3d;
>  transform: rotateX(30deg) rotateY(30deg);
>  background-color: red;
>}
>```

![[Pasted image 20240926144058.png|center|70]]




Up to this point, all the 3D elements should be on the fathers container plane with the same rotation.

>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```css
>.side {
>  position: absolute;
>  width: 2em;
>  height: 2em;
>  background: rgba(tomato, .6);
>  border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.5);
>  color: white; 
>  text-align: center;
>  line-height: 2em;
>}
>```

Now, all the elements will be rotated **based** on their father container plane, therefore, all of them must have the `position: absolute`. This will position all of the elements over their fathers container.

4. `translateZ()` and then `transform` with a rotation of needed. To do this, don't see the plane as a rotate container, but image I have a normal, un-rotated, plane. 

>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```css
>.front  { transform:                  translateZ(1em); }
>.top    { transform: rotateX( 90deg)  translateZ(1em); }
>.right  { transform: rotateY( 90deg)  translateZ(1em); }
>.left   { transform: rotateY(-90deg)  translateZ(1em); }
>.bottom { transform: rotateX(-90deg)  translateZ(1em); }
>.back   { transform: rotateY(-180deg) translateZ(1em); }
>```
