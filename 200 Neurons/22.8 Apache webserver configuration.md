[[12.8 PHP]] - [[12.11 Servers|Servers]]

>[!important]
>- By default, XAMPP uses port 80 for HTTP traffic and port 443 for HTTPS traffic. If other port is specified within the `httpd.conf` file I must write the URL explicitly with that port, so instead of `localhost/project` I have to `localhost:81/project`. 
## Apache configuration file
Usually the configuration file is locate under `user/local/apache2/conf`, and for the log is `var/log/http`. Within XAMPP is under config and `Apache (httpd.conf)`.

The file contains directives and the comments are represented by #.

All changes to the file take place after restating the server. 
## Apache directives

## Apache modules
Modules are extensions for apache. Several are commented others not.

## Conditional directives
I can include conditional directories only if a specific module is present.

## Scope directive section 
When a directive is place in the main configuration file outside of a section, they apply to the entire server. However, I can scope the directives to sections to only apply them to certain parts of the server; for example a file, directory, URL, etc. (second case)

A directive within the file configuration is somethin between `<> </>` that gives an instruction.

In the image the scope, `<Directory />... </Directory>`, is not specified to an specific directory but rather all directories on the server. But `<Directory "C:/...>` is a scope directive section.

#### Not all directives within the scope section
Some directives don't make sense to be put in certain sections. 

### Default location of the error log file

### Include...
I'm able to include other configuration file using the `include` directive, allowing to split and organize the configuration files. So instead of putting all the configuration into one file, I can split and put them in different files and then include within the main configuration file.

To do that I can create a configuration file ending in `.conf` and them, within the `httpd.conf` file add the directive with `Include conf/extra/my_custom_config.conf`.
### Virtual host

![[22.2 Virtual host]]
## htaccess files
>[!multi-column]
>
>Is a server directive file, also called distributed configuration files that allow to make configuration changes on a per directory basis. For example, putting an htaccess file within the script directory, it will apply the configuration changes to that directory and any subdirectory within it.

>![[Pasted image 20240429174134.png]]

htaccess files are read on every request and changes to these files are effective immediately, meaning I don't have to restart the apache server. 

>[!important]
>1. Not all directors can be place in htaccess files. I must check the context of the directive in the documentation.
>2. The main configuration file controls what directives can be placed in hdaccess files. 
>3. Remember to allow overwrite directive in the main configration file.
>4. The `htaccess` file must be in the root directory of the project. 
>5. There's no need to link the `htaccess` file to the main configuration file; Apache automatically reads and applies the directives to the appropriate directories. 

>[!info] Allowing htaccess file directives to be apply to htdocs files
>This grants within any file within the htdocs, the htaccess files are granted to be used.

![[Pasted image 20240429194635.png|center]]

>[!important]
>Is highly recommended don't use hd access files unless I really need to because this files are read on every request causing an impact on the server's performance.

### When to use htaccess files
Root access to the server or the main configuration is not always granted. Share hosting providers for example, they won't give full access to the main configuration file, but they allow to override some of the configuration through htaccess files. 

However if access is granted to the main configuration files, Gio suggests to disable htaccess entirely by setting allow overwrite to none, thus the server is not even attempt to look for htaccess files. 

![[Pasted image 20240310161240.png|center|450]]


The most common use for htaccess files is to rewrite URLs, however, if having access to the main configuration file, I can simply move that rewrite rules into the main configuration file, or even better move it into a separate configuration file and included from the main configuration file.

>[!info] htaccess use cases
>Use mode rewrite module that allows to rewrite and manipulate requesting URLs, performing redirects, pattern matching using regular expressions.

Here are the most common usage of the `.htaccess files`.
### Rewrite URLs
This URL `project.localhost/about.php` is neither user or SEO friendly. 

![[Pasted image 20240310162139.png]]

Now, create a public directory and put `index.php` there and create a htacces file to direct the traffic through that index.php file and decide within that index.php file which page to load. 

Because index.php file is the entry point to the application. the `DocumentRoot` needs to be updated adding `/public`, so it'll loads the index.php from the public directory. 

![[Pasted image 20240310162457.png|center|450]]

Restart apache and detail in the browser directory there is no need to use the word public in the URL to access to the index.php file. 

![[Pasted image 20240310162709.png]]

#### Adding support to pretty URLs
Pretty URLs could be like `programwithgio.local/blog/your-post-title` To do that 'll have to tell the server to process all requests through a proxy index.php, again this file will be the entry point to the application.  

>[!multi-column]
>
>Frist, create an htaccess file within the public directory. Second check if mod rewrite module is enable using the if module directive. Third, turn on the rewrite engine with rewriteEngine on, and finally write the conditions and rules. 
>
>![[Pasted image 20240429195823.png]]


##### Adding the conditions

>[!step] Check the requested file name is not an actual file or directory using. 
>
>The reason is because I need to check whether the requested URL does not map to an existing directory (!-d) and does not map to an existing file (!-f).  
>
>For example, if the user were to request an asset (image, css, js, etc.), that's under public directory, we don't want to process that through index.php, I can just serve it as is. 

>[!info]- What is mapping?
>Process of associating a URL or a portion of a URL with a physical location on the server's file system.
>- If a user requests http://example.com/images/ and there is a directory named images in the server's file system, then the URL http://example.com/images/ "maps to" the existing directory images.
>- If a user requests http://example.com/example.html and there is a file named example.html in the server's file system, then the URL http://example.com/example.html "maps to" the existing file example.html.
>In the case the URL maps to an existing file or directory, the server may serve the corresponding file (for example if the requested file is `index.php`) or the specified file.

```PHP
//Check if the requested file name is not a directory or file
RewriteCond %(REQUESTED_FILENAME) !-d
RewriteCond %(REQUESTED_FILENAME) !-f
```
--- 
>[!info] Rewrite the condition
>In this case, everything (`^`) is going to be redirected to `index.php`

![[Pasted image 20240310163836.png]]

Up to this point, if visit `/about` or any other path, the browser will display Hello world, because that's the content of `index.php` and the previous route redirects everything to it.

![[Pasted image 20240310163930.png|center|450]]


Now, to load the actual about page, that can be done by parsing the URL and requiring the necessary file or by using something call routing, but briefly, usign var-dump the request URI. 

![[Pasted image 20240310164309.png]]

In this case, blog/post/1 is the requested URL, then I can parse that and extract that blog is my page and post one is maybe the parameter I passed and so on. 

### Without using htaccess files
I can add the ifmodule directive to the vhost, affecting only one specific website (case of the image). Or put that under the main configuration file to apply to everything  

![[Pasted image 20240310164545.png|center|400]]


>The only change I have to make to the directive is add a `/` before index.php

![[Pasted image 20240310164757.png|center]]

Doing this will loads the index.php from the DocumentRoot and this DocumentRoot is set to public 

>[!important]
>Detail without htaccess file, the pretty URLs won't work. Also up to this point, apache wasn't restarted.
>
>![[Pasted image 20240310165021.png]]

When restarted, look I don't have an htaccess file.
