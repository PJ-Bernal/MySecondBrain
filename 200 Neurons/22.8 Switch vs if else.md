[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

## Switch
>[!multi-column]
>
>Allows to compare the same expressions to multiple different values and run different parts of code based on which value matches each expression. If no match is found, the default case is used, but is not required to included in the switch code. 
>%% %%
>First, the expression is evaluated, then when the matching case is found and the case will be executed line by line until the next `break` statement is found.

>[!multi-column]
>
>To avoid code redundance I can join two cases together.
>%% %%
>In this case, if the $paymentstatus is declined or rejected, then the echo line will be executed.

>[!important]
>Switch statement do regular comparison, not the strict one.

## Switch within loops
### Break
The break statement of the switch will break only the switch statements and no the loop. Or I can break the loop with `break 2;`

>Breaking both using break 2.

### Continue
PHP will suggest to use `continue 2` and is better if the value already match a case, there is no need to continue searching the other cases. Detail in the image, there is no break line after paid because the continue 2, skip the code above it for the first value, so the br tag is never interpreted. 

>[!error]- 
>![[Pasted image 20240408203926.png]]
>This warning is because `continue` is similar to `break`, but using continue means I want to continue looping through the switch looking for more cases, so I need to use `continue 2;`

## Switch vs if else with functions
When using `if` and `else`, the condition is executed for each one of the `if` and `else` statements. For example, in this case only `if(x() === 1)` is executed because the return value is 1. 

![[Pasted image 20240408204316.png|center|450]]

But in this case, all statements are evaluated, and the function is being called three times, so sleeps 9 seconds and echoes done 3 times. 

![[Pasted image 20240306102237.png|center|450]]

>In this case, on the first if, the function is called, wait three seconds, return 3, the condition is false, done is printed; then goes to the first elseif,  wait three seconds, return 3, the condition is false, done is printed. This until the condition is true and 3 is echoed. >The total time was 9 seconds and the function was called three times.

### Assign to a variable
A solution for the delay is to assign the function to a variable. Thus, the function will be interpreted once, and the value **not the function*** will be compared once.

### Using switch
When using switch, the condition is executed **once**, and the result of it gets compared to each case. Also, there's no need to assign the function to a variable.
