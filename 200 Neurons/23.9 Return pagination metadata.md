The bare minimum metadata of the returned collection should be:
- Include links to the previous and next pages.
- Total count, total amount of pages, page number, page size.

This paging information is included in the response body itself, often with a metadata tag, or paging info tag.


>[!important]
>- If the consumer request `applicatoin/json`, the above is not a JSON representation of the authors collection, because now, the metadata property is there. The above is a new media type. 
>
>- Returning the paging info combined with `application/json` breaks REST, the above response is not adhering to the self-descriptive message constrain; the consumer doesn't know how to interpret the response with `Content-type: application/json`
>
>- Paging information isn't part of the resource representation, and should be included in the response header like `X-Pagination`, so the consumer then can parse that information to obtain metadata details.
