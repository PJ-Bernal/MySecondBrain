[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]
## Callback
When a function is pass to another function as an argument and then is called within that function it's called a callback function. PHP has a lot of build in functions that expect a callback function as an argument like `array_map` or `array_filter`.

Detail the callback is expecting a callable data type.

## Callable data type
It refers to the callable function that I use as an argument. 
## How to pass a callback function as an argument
1. Define an anonymous function directly.

2. Assigning an anonymous function to a variable.

3. Defining a function as a user-define function, passing it as a string.

4. Embed a user define function as a callback within an anonymous function. in this case, I want to use the anonymous function with the result of the foo function; That's possible by calling the foo function within the anonymous as a $callback, so the return in reality is `foo(array_sum(1, 2, 3, 4));`

Detail the callback is being hinted using the `callable` data type. Remember when invoking the father function, the callable can be embed using a string (above) or be embedded directly (below).

## Closure vs callable
Anonymous functions are instances of closures, so when type casting to closure, it must be an anonymous function where callable can be a user function (as the second example above).

Because of that, **only** when using anonymous functions, I can type hint to closure the parameter.

But a callable data type can be a user define function.
