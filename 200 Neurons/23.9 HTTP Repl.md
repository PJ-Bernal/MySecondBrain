# Installing HTTP REPL
The docs are: test web apis with the httprepl.

To install see the docs. And to test the installing, in the command line inside of the project write: httprepl and output should be disconnected.

# Testing with HTTPREPL
First, disable authentication commenting the authorize attribute on the controllers. Then execute the api and switch to the cmd.

HTTPRepl is used to navigate through the API as I navigate to a regular directory sttucture, with ls, cd, etc. Meaning navigate to the desire url path and then send the request.

## Connect to the API
Execute: `httprepl <base address>` 

![[Pasted image 20250203094355.png|center]]

The command prompt is set to that URI

I must execute exit and connect again after making a change in the code base and executing the api. 

## Provide the specification
Is not require httprepl find the OpenAPI description but is better because through it httprepl know how the api is structured. Because the documentation has several versions, the open api description is not located in a default endpoint like `/swagger/v1/swagger.json` or `/openapi.json /swagger/v1/swagger.json` or `/openapi.json`. And httprepl doesn’t know which version I want to test. 

To provide a description, first, go to the desire testing version in swagger, and click on the swagger link on the left to find the open api specification, copy the url and past it to the connect command. The use the `--openapi` flag.

## Navigate through the api 
Use the ls and cd commands to navigate through the api. Once an endpoint is reached, detail the method on the right.

Finally enter the endpoint and write the desire method.

Detail the command prompt is the same as the paths use for the users to consume the API. Meaning if I ls inside of a path I should get a single path, but in this case I got two.

Detail the endpoint route is the same as the prompt: api/v2/cities/, but httprepl is showing two routes, id and cityId.

HTTPRepl is showing two endpoints because he scans all the OpenAPI specification searching what could go after `/cities/` in the controllers action methods. 

In the case of the cities controller, the route is `/api/v{version.apiVersion}/cities/`, and given the http get attribute, the following parameter is `{id}`, meaning the full url can be `/api/v{version.apiVersion}/cities/id`. 

>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20250203095635.png]]

And for the poi controller, what comes after `cities/` is directly `/{cityId}`




>For the app design, the cities api, that’s wrong because after cities/ the following parameter is a city id, but I got `id` and `cityId`. 

>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20250203095905.png]]

According to the output in the cmd, the only method available is a get for id, meaning if I do cd 1, I will be inside cities/1, but doing an ls, wont show another path to get the poi, and this is because the route for cities is `cities/`, and the path for poi is `cities/{cityId}`, they are DIFFERENT paths.

Therefore, I need to ‘link’ those two paths. Realistically, there's no way to state I want to use city id or id when making a request using an URL, meaning **different name parameters used in the route attribute inside of the controllers WONT lead to different paths**.

To make both controllers be able to use the same url, change the http attribute parameter and the action method parameter.

>[!important]
>To make this easier, think, what should be the next uri follow the current url path, in this case, what should come next after cities. 

This time, there's only one location to navigate to, cityid, if I navigate inside that I get the poi.

# Post method
Navigate to an end point with a post method, the help flag shows I can alter the body and the post headers.

![[Pasted image 20250203100238.png|center]]


## Configuring an editor to alter the body
Execute the command and after `.default` indicate the desire editor. In this case is note pad.

![[Pasted image 20250203100315.png|center]]

---
To send a post request, I must add the content-type header. After executing the note pad will open.

![[Pasted image 20250203100412.png|center]]

The note pad will show a sample body provided by the open api specification. ![[Pasted image 20250203100427.png]]

Put the body of the post request, in this case a name a description to create a poi ![[Pasted image 20250203100439.png]]

Save the note pad, close it and the post is send.
