[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

The call stack helps Ruby keep track of what method is executing as well as where execution should resume when it returns; the call stack puts information about the current method on the top of the stack, then removes that information when the method returns.

>[!info]
>In Ruby, Blocks, procs, and lambdas also use the call stack; in fact, they all use the same call stack as Ruby uses for methods. 

Check [this](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/methods#callstack) page to understand how the call stack works in Ruby.
