[[12.12 React|React]]

When a form is submitted, RR will handle it client-side, without a full page reload (as the old way used to do), using the `<Form>` component.

```jsx
<form action="/submit-contact" method="post">
  <input name="name" />
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>

// React Router way
<Form method="post">
  <input name="name" />
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</Form>
```

## Links and forms behavior - action property
Unlike `<a href=''>` elements, the `<form>` element can perform both GET and POST requests, change the URL and send data, and include a request body with data (POST request). 

RR mimics the POST and GET behavior, without sending any request to the server, but handling client-side, taking the data and send it to a route called `action`, which is a property of the route object, binds to a function telling how to handle form submissions. 

>Action don't automatically talks to the server, in the action I decide what to do with the data and how to communicate with the server. 

The action property is the middleman between the client and the server. Inside of the action is the code to communicate to the server to fetch or call the server, then the server save the information and sends back a confirmation, the action completes and the route refresh the data. 

This `action` property is required only for POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE methods. Get don't need an action because get only retrieves/read data.

```jsx
// POST request
<Form method="post" action="/create-user">
  <input name="username" />
  <input name="email" />
</Form>
// When submitted, React Router sends the data to 
// your route action instead of the server:
{
  path: "/create-user",
  action: async ({ request }) => {
    // request.formData() contains username and email
    const formData = await request.formData();
    const username = formData.get("username");
    // Handle the form submission here
  }
}

// GET request
<Form method="get" action="/search">
  <input name="query" />
</Form>
// React Router updates URL to /search?query=whatever
// but handles it client-side without a server request
```

Just like loaders, is recommended to have the action property in a separate file, like in [[22.12 Loader and useLoaderData|this node]]. This example is writing the function inside of the router in main, this is not a good practice. 

The action property follow the same logic as the loader, in which it could be sync or async etc.
