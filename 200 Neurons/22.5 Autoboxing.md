[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

JavaScript autoboxing refers to the automatic conversion that the JavaScript engine performs between primitive values and their corresponding object wrappers. This allows primitive values to use methods and properties that are typically available only to objects. The three main primitive types that are involved in autoboxing are string, number, and boolean.

```js
let primitiveString = "hello";
console.log(primitiveString.length); // 5

let primitiveNumber = 42;
console.log(primitiveNumber.toString()); // "42"

let primitiveBoolean = true;
console.log(primitiveBoolean.toString()); // "true"
```

>The primitive types never changes from primitive to object when boxing; this process happens behind the scenes.
