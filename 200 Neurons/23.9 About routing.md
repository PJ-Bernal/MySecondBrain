# About routing
Two middleware components are require in the request pipeline to handle routing.

```c#
app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthorization(); 

app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => {
  //Endpoint mapping
})
```

Having the require components separate, allow to inject any middleware components that will run in between matching (use routing) and executing the endpoint (use endpoints). 

This in between components will know which endpoint is selected, and if needed, can select another one. A common example of this is the use authorization middleware. 
# UseRouting
Component that marks the position in the request pipeline where the routing matching is made; is where an end point is selected. 
# UseEndpoints
Component that marks the position in the request pipeline where the selected endpoint is executed. 
# Map endpoints
There are two ways of mapping the endpoints after being selected: convention (using routes) or attribute base. 

APIs tend to use attribute-base, using the `MapControllers()` method maps HTTP requests to the appropriate controller actions, without specifying routes, based on: URL patterns, HTTP methods or route attributes defined in the controllers.

## Attribute base routing
Allow to use attributes at controller and action level, combined with URI templates (in the attribute itself), thus the requests are matched to the respective controller action.

### Route 
Attribute that doesn't match to an HTTP method, is used at controller level to provide a template that will prefix all templates defined at action level.

For example, all sample URI follow the same pattern. Using the route attribute at controller level, I can create a template with the value of  `api/cities`. Thus, is not require to provide the `api/cities` value in the templates of all action-level attributes. 
## Old version of routing
This is an old version of setting up the routing:

```c#
app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthorization(); 

app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => {
  endpoints.MapControllers();
})
```

## Shorthand of routing
There's a shorthand version of routing where the two routing middleware components are omitted and replaces with `app.MapController`, calling the map controller on the web application object directly.

This is possible because the web application object implements `IEndpoints` routing directly.
