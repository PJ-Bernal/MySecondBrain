Passing test data with member, class or inline attributes don't rely on compile time checks, which is pretty bad.

# Adding test data
For that create a new class for the strong-type test data, which will derived from Theory data; indicate the type of the parameters my test cases will be, in this example, int and bool.

Then use the constructor and the Add method, to add passing the test cases. Add types must match the types passed in theory data.

# Using test data in tests
Use the class data attribute passing the above class.

This is perfect because detail the types use in the method parameters are int and bool, so I can guarantee the test cases will use those types as well.
