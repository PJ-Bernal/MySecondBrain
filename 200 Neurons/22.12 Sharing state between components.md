## Lifting state
Lifting state is the process of removing the state from the common behaved components, to move it to a common parent, and then pass hardcoded data from the common parent, add state to the parent and pass it down together with event handlers.

In this example, both panels can be opened, but an enhance require to change, if one is open, the other must be closed. 

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Panel({ title, children }) {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}>
          Show
        </button>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}

export default function Accordion() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel title="About">
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel title="Etymology">
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}
```
### Removing state of the children
When removing the state of the child components, add the state variable as a prop within the parent. 

```jsx
// State to be removed from the children
const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);

// Prop added to the parent
// Before
function Panel({ title, children}) {
// After
function Panel({ title, children, isActive }) {
```

Doing this allow the parent to control the state of its children, passing a them a value as a prop. 

### Pass hardcoded data from the parent 
The parent needs to pass as an "prop attribute" the data to control the children, in this example, the accordion can choose when to display the panels given a hardcode value of true for the `isActive` variable.

This code will keep both panels open, now I need to control that behavior added an state.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Accordion() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel title="About" isActive={true}>
        ...
      </Panel>
      <Panel title="Etymology" isActive={true}>
        ...
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Add state to the common parent
To allow only one parent active at a time, the component needs to track which panel is active. 

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Accordion() {
  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel
        title="About"
        isActive={activeIndex === 0}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}
      >
        ..
      </Panel>
      <Panel
        title="Etymology"
        isActive={activeIndex === 1}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}
      >
        ...
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}

function Panel({
  title,
  children,
  isActive,
  onShow
}) {
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={onShow}>
          Show
        </button>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}
```
