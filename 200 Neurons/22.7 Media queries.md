[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

Media queries help to change not how an element is layout, but how the global CSS change according to the screen size; from changing margin, padding, to shift completely a layout.

## Syntax
This is the basic syntax. I can use an unlimited amount of media queries and they can shift what ever CSS property I need. When the media type is the screen, there is no need to write that, like the second example. 

```css
@media media type and (condition: breakpoint) {
  // CSS rules
}
```

In this example, the margin changes when the screen is below or equal to 600px. Though is general to use `max-width` (to apply a style to an screen up to the defined value of max width). Is also possible to use `min-width` which applies to screens that are larger than a given value. 

```css
body {
  margin: 24px;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    margin: 8px;
  }
}
```



## Breakpoints
There is no a defined rule for breakpoints, but approximate:
- Mobile devices are usually under 500px.
- Tables are between 500px and 1000px. 
- Regular screens are above 1000px. 

My project shouldn't have media queries foe each device, rather focus only on the ones I need.
