## Encapsulation

### About public attributes
In some specific cases are useful, like data transfer objects DTO; and some frameworks use them. 
### How to access or change a private class attribute?

### When to use setters or getters?
If some logic needs to be done prior to set the attribute, or get the property (like doing some validation or formatting), then getters and setters are useful.

>A big advice is not rush to create setters and getters for every single attribute until I really need them. Don't create setters and getters just because I have a property.  

### Method chaining with setters
I can do method chaining with setters, that help me to build my object 'step-by-step', this is like a 'fluent' construction.
### Getters and setters break encapsulation?
In the above example, though the code is using a setter, encapsulation is being broke because the constructor argument is 25, but I'm passing 125, so the state of the object change. Therefore, getters and setters can easily break encapsulation, in some cases, like this one. So they are not always the best practice.

### What's the best approach? 
If an attribute represents the state of the object, make it private, and don't create any method that change that state attribute of the object. Instead, accept the value declare as an argument in the constructor or through the method that I call to get the value, instead of a setter.  

If the object need to change its state, simply create a new object, instead of change the state of the first object. So finally, delete any setters and think of leave a getter if really needed.

### Public or private methods
Methods that are internal implementations and build other methods, should be private, and used within the class itself.

>In this example, `generateReceipt()` and `sendEmail()` are methods call within the `process()` methods, therefore, I shouldn't be able to invoke any of those methods individually and outside of the class, thus, they should be private. 
>%% %%
>In this case, because the method is public, the `generateReceipt()` method can be called without even called `process()`, and that don't make any sense. 
>%% %%
>In this case, both methods must be private or protective

### How to access private attributes
Probably I won't never use this in a real app, but is a nice trick.
