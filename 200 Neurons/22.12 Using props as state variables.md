[[12.12 React|React]]

Never **initialize** state variables directly to prop; if the parent component passes a different value, the state won't be updated (the initialization only occurs during the first render, later updates of the parent, won't affect the child). 

If I need to use a parent variable and keep it in sync within the component implementation, create a constant regular variable.
```jsx
// Don't do this
function Message({ messageColor }) {
const [color, setColor] = useState(messageColor);
// Do this instead
function Message({ messageColor }) {
const color = messageColor;
```

The only reason to mirroring props as a state variables is if my component want to ignore all updates for a specific prop, in this case, name the prop with a proper name like initial or default.

```jsx
function Message({ initialColor }) {
  // The `color` state variable holds the *first* value of `initialColor`.
  // Further changes to the `initialColor` prop are ignored.
  const [color, setColor] = useState(initialColor);
```
