[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

By default only the JSON input and output formatter are registered and used. A request without an `Accept` header will still get back JSON.

But detail what happen when requesting XML.

There are two things to fix here: adding support for XML and, if the media type is not supported by the API, it shouldn't default to the default (JSON) type, as the consumer won't be able to parse the response.

# Handling unsupported media types
Inside of the startup helper extension method where the services are added, configure the `AddControllers` services.

There are many things to configure, but the `ReturnHttpNotAcceptable` boolean property, when false, the API will return responses in the default supported format if an unsupported media type is requested (by default is false).  Set that to true to get a 406.

# Adding support for XML
Use `outPutFormatter`, and add. The first one in that list is the default format ASP will use.

This is the manual way to do add xml support.

But this is the same.
