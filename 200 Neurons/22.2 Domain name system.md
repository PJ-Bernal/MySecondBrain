## What is a DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System) is a distributed database which translates domain names to IP addresses that can be used to make a request to the server. 
## Structure of domains
A domain is compound of several parts separated by dots and read from right to left.

### TLD
Or top-level domain, inform the general purpose of the service behind the domain, like .com .org. .edu Some TLDs enforce stricter policies for example:
- .us .fr can require the service to be provided in a given language or hosted in a certain country.
- .gov are only allowed to be used by government. 
### Label
Is a case-insensitive character sequence anywhere from one to sixty-three characters in length containing letter from A to Z and numbers from 0 to 9 and the character - (that may not be the first or the last character label).

The label located right before the TLD is called a secondary level domain (SLD).

A domain name can have many labels, meaning for any domain (e.g. mozilla.org) I can create 'subdomains' with different content like: developer.mozilla.org, iot.mozilla.org or bugzilla.mozilla.org

## DNS Refreshing
DNS databases are stored on every DNS server worldwide that refers to a few special servers called "authoritative name servers" or "top-level DNS servers" (boss servers that manage the system). This servers are organized hierarchically and no single DNS server contains the complete database. If a DNS server doesn't contain a requested domain name, the DNS server routes the request to another DNS server up the hierarchy. 

When the information is register or updated in a domain, it must be refreshed in every DNS database. Each DNS server stores the information for certain time before it is automatically invalidated and then refreshed. Thus, it takes some time for DNS servers that know about this domain name to get the up-to-date information.

## A simplify DNS request process
1. A website is typed in the web browser.
2. The browser creates and HTTP request which is packaged up and sent to the device's network.
3. If my pc has a record of the IP associated to that domain, it will use the local DNS cache, and the browser negotiates content with the web server.
4. If the IP address isn't cached, a DNS request will be made to the DNS to obtain the IP for the domain. 
5. The packaged-up HTTP request goes over internet where is directed to the server with the matching IP address. 
6. The remote server accepts the request and sends a respond back to my network which hands it to my browser. 
7. The browser displays the response in the form of a webpage.
