Specific validations, like the description must be different from the title, can't be covered using data annotations, (errors from validation result in an invalid model state), use an validatable object.

The og code.

The interface provides an object that can be invalidated in any desired way.

See the custom rule in action.

In this example, both title and description have the same lenght and text stirng, but detaul the cross-property validatoin is not fired, there's no message saying the descripton must be different from the title.

This happens because the Validate method is not executed when one of the data validation annotations already resulted in the object being invalid. This is a default behavior, and sometimes this is a good way because cross-property validations can be complex, so make sense to not trigger them if the input is invalid anyway.
