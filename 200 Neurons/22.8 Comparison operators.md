[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

## Comparison operators
Allow to compare two values. For the spaceship operator, it returns 0 if the variables are equal, -1 if the first variable is less than the second, and 1 if the first variable is greater than the second. **Strict comparison don't cast** to other datatypes to make the comparison.  ^e2f7a3

Before PHP 8, when comparing a string to a integer, the string was converted to number before the comparison. 

```PHP
var_dump(0 == 'hello'); 
// Prior to PHP 8, this is what really happen. Stirng gets converted
var_dump(0 == '0'); // true 
```

Since PHP 8, if the string is not numeric, the other side will be converted to string; and then, a string comparison happens. 

```PHP
var_dump(0 == 'hello'); 
//Since PHP 8, this will happen. Int is converted to string
var_dump('0' == 'hello'); // false
```

### Strict comparison
Is recommended to use strict comparison when possible to avoid potential bugs.

>The function `strpos` return the index of the letter, 0 in this case. Using loose comparison, the output is H not found, because 0 is converted to boolean, so the if is true.
