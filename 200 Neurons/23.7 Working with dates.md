[[13.7 C Sharp|C#]]

C# has a DateTime type that represents a certain date and/or time. Also the TimeSpan type that represents a period of time. Both, are known as structures(?). 

To declare a variable: `DateTime employeeStartDate = new DateTime(2025, 03, 03);` Detail this is not like the primitives, because it creates an instance with the constructor member.  

Operations between dates require the use of method member apply on the variables that hold the date, for example: `DateTime startDate = hireDate.AddDays(15);`
