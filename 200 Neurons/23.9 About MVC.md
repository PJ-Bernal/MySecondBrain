# About MVC
MVC is a design pattern that implements a view, a controller and a model, that encourages loose coupling and separation of concenrs. For an API, the view is how the data or resources are represented to the user (usually a JSON).

As an overview: when a request is made by an API consumer, an action on the controller is trigger, that sends any inputted data (by the user) to the mode that returns a view. That view doesn't contain any Razor or logic, but a data/resource representation, usually a JSON. 

## Models
Group of classes that make up the domain data and the logic to manage the data (usually with a repository class). They include all the Data Transfer Object classes.

The model handles the logic of the application to retrieve or store data. However, sometimes, the model doesn't even contain logic at all. 

### About DTOs
simple classes that don't have any dependencies or framework-specific base classes. They contain properties and some basic methods; and don't inherit from any special base class. DTO classes represent business concepts/entities. 

Typically the classes in the model represents everything the user will work with (pie class, order class) even classes that allow interaction with the database (repositories). 

The DTO are serialized into response bodies, or in RESTful terminology, resource representations. 

>Serialize means DTO objects (which are typically simple C# classes or records) are converted into a format that can be transmitted over HTTP, such as JSON or XML
## Controllers
Provide logic that works on the model and provide data for the view to display. Controllers have action methods. Image a controller as the transit officer in the MVC pattern, it use the model and view, to create a response that will send back to the client. 

Is responsible for user interaction, for example, when clicking a button the request is send to a server ad pick by the controller; handling incoming requests invoking an appropriate method, called action or action method, that will return a view.  

The controller creates the response base on user interaction, it will update the model in response to user interaction, and will select which view to be used to represent the model data.  

The controller doesn't need to know how the actual data persistence works (the model hide that from the controller) 
## View
Contain logic that displays data to the user that can be process by a controller action. It can be considered a template, markup use to visualize the data. In ASP.NET Core the view templates are cshtml files.

The request arrives to one of the controller classes that usually have action methods, public methods, that get associated with a URL. This means, when the user navigates to an specific URL, a specific method on the controller will be invoked. 

After that, some code will trigger on the model and a view will be selected to be displayed with the data, from the model, to the user.

When a request is made, an action method on the controller is trigger, that will sends any data in the request body (like a query string) to the model, that returns a model to the view.

Typically create three folders name Controllers, Views, and Models.
