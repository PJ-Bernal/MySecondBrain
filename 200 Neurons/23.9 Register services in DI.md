# The services and builder
The [[23.9 The default program.cs ASP.NET Core file#About the first line of code|WebApplicationBuilder instance]] provides access to the Services collection (use to add the services) where the services are register; this collection is accessible through `builder.Services.

Different kinds of services can be added, being the main two framework and custom services:
## Framework service
Refer to the ASP.NET Core built-in services, which usually have extension methods (methods with a down arrow when hover with the mouse).

>[!important]
>Services are required for the app to be able to use and work with instances and data in certain way. Meaning, using only a MVC template won't make the app MVC directly, services must be added.

## Custom services
User-defined classes should be register within the container, using its interface. To add a custom class, use any of the below methods, including the name of the interface and the class, as [[23.7 Collections#Generic lists or `List<T>`|list]].


# Different ways to make DI registration
Different methods exists to add services to the DI container, they differ from how the objects are instantiated and how long they live, 

>[!multi-column]
>
>>## AddTransient
>>Every time the DI container is asked for an instance, it creates a new clear instance. Useful for lightweight stateless services. 
>
>>## AddSingleton
>>A singleton is created for the entire app. Every time the instance is requested, the DI container provides the same one. 
>
>>## AddScope
>>Most common used option, instances are created once within the scope of the request, and per request. That will create a singleton while the request is being handled. Use with entity framework for context and repository.

>[!explanation]- Add scope explanation
>Say that a request comes in and in instance, an object that implements the IPieRepository is needed for component A. A could be, for example, a controller. The container will create a new object probably a pie repository incident and is kept alive as long as the request is being handled. If somewhere later in the handling of the request another IPieRepository instance is requested say by component B, so still within the scope of the request, the same old one is reused, hence, the name of the method AddScoped. When the request is handled and the response is sent back to the client, the object will be discarded.

>[!importnat]- About singleton
>When a class is used throughout the whole application, this is, using a singleton pattern, it could be a candidate of being a singleton, therefore, if it has static properties for the singleton instance, delete that and add the class as a service.

## AddKeyedScope
Same as add scope but with a label to request that specific service in the code. Useful when multiple services implement the same interface and I need one specific.
