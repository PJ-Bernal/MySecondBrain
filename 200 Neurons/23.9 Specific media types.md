# About semantic media types
Consumer might want a resource, but in different representations, so `application/json` is not enough. 

![[Pasted image 20250207083425.png]]

In this case, vendor specific accept header a better approach. This are semantic media types, which are types that tell the consumer what the consumer what the data means. 

![[Pasted image 20250207083457.png]]

When the response include hateoas, include that in the semantic media type with a suffix. Even more semantic options can be implemented.

![[Pasted image 20250207083723.png|center|350]]

However, there should be one suffix per media type, and only registered suffixes should be used; meaning the above will work but violate best practices. Therefore is better to add the hateoas part to the type itself.

![[Pasted image 20250207083931.png|center|350]]

if no semantic is passed, return the application/json.

# Implementation
Add the respective dto classes.

![[Pasted image 20250207084113.png]]

Then add mapping. The og code.

![[Pasted image 20250207084210.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250207084219.png]]

In the author controller. First check the subtype without suffix, without +json, and check if that matches hateoas. 

The og code.

![[Pasted image 20250207084420.png]]

Include links check the accept header ends with hateoas. If that the case, then create the links.

Now, I need to differentiate between full author, friendly author and app/json. The last two will be the default, I only need to check for the full author part of the media type. That's what primary media type does, it check the media type with suffix, or without suffix and without the hateoas. 

![[Pasted image 20250207084531.png]]

If that matches, return the full author. 

![[Pasted image 20250207085154.png]]

In any other case, return a friendly author representation.

![[Pasted image 20250207085217.png]]

Delete that and the return ok. Code ends in 260

# Testing
There's no formatter.

![[Pasted image 20250207085307.png]]

# Adding produces
The produces attribute restrict the media types an action will produce, passing all the types that are allowed to be produces by the action. This is extremely restrictive and any type not included will produce a 406. 

I can apply this attribute to controller level or even globally if needed. 

![[Pasted image 20250207085553.png]]

Now it works.

![[Pasted image 20250207085718.png]]![[Pasted image 20250207085736.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250207085750.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250207085801.png]]


No accept header.
