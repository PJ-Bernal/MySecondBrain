[[12.10 Docker|Docker]]

1. Having an application whose dependencies are in certain state.
2. Create an image (this can be automatized using Git and Jenkins).
3. Upload the image to a repository for docker files (like docker hub). 
4. When I need the image, I pull the image from the repository, build the container and that's it.
