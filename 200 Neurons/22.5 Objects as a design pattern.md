[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]
## Don't use object literals if
The simplest way to organize and start to create code is by grouping things into objects. For example, for a tic tac toe game.

```javascript
// example one
const playerOneName = "tim";
const playerTwoName = "jenn";
const playerOneMarker = "X";
const playerTwoMarker = "O";

// example two
const playerOne = {
  name: "tim",
  marker: "X"
};

const playerTwo = {
  name: "jenn",
  marker: "O"
};

```

However, [[22.5 What is an object - object creation - object constructors and object literals - user defined functions - add properties to object literals#How to create an object|using object literals]] should be reserve to create single and unique objects, and not group a lot of them. For example, there is not way to create a function that print the name of the players.

```js
// Though I have this function, I can't use it with object literals
function printName(player) {
  console.log(player.name);
}

// Instead I have to do this
console.log(playerOne.name);
console.log(playerTwo.name);
```

## Use constructor functions
Much better with [[22.5 What is an object - object creation - object constructors and object literals - user defined functions - add properties to object literals#Using a constructor function|CF]], when I need a blueprint for an object that has to be replicated several times. 

```js
// Constructor Function
function Player(name, marker) {
  this.name = name;
  this.marker = marker;
  this.sayName = function() {
    console.log(this.name)
  };
}

// Instance creation of the object
const player1 = new Player('steve', 'X');
const player2 = new Player('also steve', 'O');

player1.sayName(); // logs 'steve'
player2.sayName(); // logs 'also steve'
```
