[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Same as each with index, but with map. The block variables are two, the value and the index.

```ruby
array = %w(a b c)
array.map.with_index { |ch, idx| [ch, idx] }
# [["a", 0], ["b", 1], ["c", 2]]
```

If I don't want to start at index 0 I can pass an argument to the method `.map_with_index(3)`.
