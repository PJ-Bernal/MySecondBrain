[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

When a grid resize to a very small value, the browser will stop until the `width: min-content` value; however, with the `min()` and `max()` functions I can define values manually, instead of relying on min-content.

In order to really works, one of the argument must be a dynamic value. Check [this pen](https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/PoJwwLq). Remember the percentage takes the container as a reference; so  the grid row size will be calculated from the values 200px and 50% grid containerâ€™s height. 

```CSS
.grid-container {
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, min(200px, 50%));
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, max(120px, 15%));
}
```

>Remember, when using min, I'm really setting a max-height for one track. On the other hand, using max sets a minimum value.
