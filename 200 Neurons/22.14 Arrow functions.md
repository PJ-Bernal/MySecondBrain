[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

Arrow functions are anonymous functions that are bind to a variable. If the arrow function has a single statement, TS can infer the type easily, so annotating is not required in that case. 

```ts
const LogMessage = (message: string): void => console.log(message);

const LogMessage = (message: string) => console.log(message);
```

Even though in JS, arrow functions with a single parameter doesn't require a parenthesis, in TS they need it if when being annotate.

```ts
// not like this
const LogMessage = message: string: void => console.log(message);
```
