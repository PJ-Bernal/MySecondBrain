## What are transitions
>[!blank-container|float-left-small]
>![[Pasted image 20241007095818.png]]

By default, all CSS changes happen instantaneously. But  transitions interpolate rules from an initial state (defined when the element have its first css rules) to a final state (any other rule apply after the initial state). This interpolation required the name of the property to animate (interpolate) and its duration as `transition` rules within the initial state. This shorthand allows to interpolate properties as a comma-separated list. 

```css
.btn {
  transition:
    transform 250ms,
    opacity 400ms;
}
.btn:hover {
  transform: scale(1.2);
  opacity: 0;
}
```

>[!important]
>The transition works only between same property units, from `10px` to `100px`, and not between different units, `10px` to `auto`. When any state unit uses a keyword, the `interpolate-size: allow-keywords` property must be within the initial state of the element.

This animations are known as implicit transitions as the initial and final state of the element are implicitly defined by the browsers. [Not all CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties) ca be transitioned. 

>[!important]
>Each animation takes exactly 1 second. Thus, transition timing function describes how a css rule should interpolate from 0 to 1 seconds, and not how quickly the animation should complete. 
## The transition rule
The shorthand for the following rules is `transition: <property> <duration> <time-functioning> <delay>`. 

```css
button {
  /* ... other CSS properties ... */
  transition-property: background-color;
  transition-duration: 1s;
  transition-timing-function: ease-out;
  transition-delay: 0.25s;
}
```

- Property: determine **which rules** will be transitioned. I can put several properties separated by an space or none (to not change anything). 
- Time functioning: determine the speed of the transition. Check [the docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-timing-function) to see all the available values. 
- Delay: determine the delay for the transition to start.  Several delays, each one is going to be apply to the corresponding transition property.
### Timing functions
The `transition-duration` rule determine the duration. If I put several durations, each one is going to be apply to the corresponding transition property.

```css
transition-duration: 3s, 1s;
transition-property: margin-right, color;
```

Transitions are trigger by any change in the initial state, the initial set of rules, applied to an element. So, adding a class using JS will trigger a transition. 

There are several duration functions (values).

>`linear` less used.

>`ease-out` Use when something enters the screen, like a modal.

>`ease-in` Use when something left the screen.

>![[Pasted image 20241007145707.png|150]]
>`ease-in-out` Useful for something that happen in a loop.

>`ease` default value if no timing function is provided. 

Another way function on hand is step. 

#### Custom curves 
Use the `cubic-bezier()` function, and select the values using [this](https://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67) website. Or use this [ease functions website](https://easings.net/), though some of them don't work well.

This are some 'exaggerated' versions of the four basic time functions, as the plain values (ease, ease-in, etc.) are a bit "subtle". 

```css
.btn {
  /* ease-out */
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.215, 0.61, 0.355, 1);

  /* ease-in */
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.75, 0, 1, 1);

  /* ease-in-out */
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.645, 0.045, 0.355, 1);

  /* ease */
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.44, 0.21, 0, 1);
}
```
