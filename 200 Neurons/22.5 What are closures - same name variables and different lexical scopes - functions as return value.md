Closures are created implicitly when a function is defined inside another function that retains access to its outer scope; this **function or object is _bundle_ together with its lexical scope**, thus, with the closure I can access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In summary, a closure is a function with preserved data.

>- Closures can return functions directly or objects (in which one of the properties can be another function). See the two subtitles below.

When `makeAdding(5)` is executed here * a closure is created. Now, the `add5` variable gets as a return value a reference to the `resulting()` function, and thanks to the closure of `makeAdding()`, also has the photograph, the lexical scope, in which the `first` variable exists. Thus, when `add5()` is executed as a function, it has access to all variables/objects/functions present in its scope, including `first` and `resulting()` in this case.

When the closure function is created it gets a life-time picture of the variables present in their lexical scope. Thus, the `first` variable still exists in memory because the closure still references it, even though the `makeAdding` function has completed execution. 



## Functions as return value of closures
```js
function outerFunction(x) {
    let y = 10;
    //Instead of 
    // return function innerFunction () {...}
    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(x + y);
    }
    return innerFunction;
}

const closure = outerFunction(5);
closure(); // Outputs 15
```

If for some reason I don't know what is holding the binding return by the closure, I can simply `console.log()`. 
## Objects as return value of closures
```js
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    return {
        increment: function() {
            count++;
        },
        getCount: function() {
            return count;
        }
    };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.getCount()); // 1
console.log(counter.count); // undefined
```


## Closures keep the state of the variables they modify
```js
 const counterCreator = () => {
    let count = 0;
    return () => {
      console.log(count);
      count++;
    };
  };
  
  const counter = counterCreator();
  
  counter(); // 0
  counter(); // 1
  counter(); // 2
  counter(); // 3
```
