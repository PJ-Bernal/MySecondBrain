[[12.6 Git and Github|Git and Github]]

I should create a copy of the project by forking from the project GitHub website, simply by clicking the forking button. Once is my GitHub, I can close as usual and now the project is in my repo and I can do as I please. 

Additionally, I have to upstream the project [question:: Why I have to upstream a forked project] with `git remote add upstream 'URL of the project'` in which the URL comes from the repo of the owner of the project, not my repo.

[question:: I push something into my clone but nothing happened on my fork, where is the file?]

## What is a pull request?
Request to pull my branch of modify files into the real project, not my clone. First use `git push origin 'my branh name'`. Then go to my GitHub account to the clone and from there I should create the pull request clicking in the 'compare and pull request'. Complete all and hit create pull request.

Once a branch has request a pull request, every push that branch have will be accumulate to the same request. This is important, this means one branch equals one pull request. One pull request should have only one thing pushed, not several. I can't create a second pull request on a branch that already has a pull request on it. 

## Remove a push from a pull request
First, located in the branch I want to un-pull, use the `git reset 'has-code'` command. Then, do whatever to the documents reset (that will be on the stage area). Finally I have to push again using force with `git push origin 'branch name' -f` this will make a new pull request. 

## When the main project accept pull requests
Because in my repo resides a clone of the project, every commit I make is not reflected on my fork, remember, this is a exact copy of the project. However, when the main project accepts pull requests, I can fetch (like fill) my clone with the latest version of the repo. 
To do that, in my clone click on fetch upstream.

By doing this, when another person make a pull into the main project I can quickly 'update' my repo to check that. 

This could be done in the CLI, relocating the branch in the main branch `git checkout main`, the `git fetch --all --prune` when all refers to fetch all the branches. Then, `get reset --hard upstream/main`. To make sure everything is ok git log must show me the same name of commits the main project has. Finally. `git push origin main` to push all the changes into my main branch, and after that my main branch is the same as the project. 

All the previous could be done with `git pull upstream main`, this command does the same. Finally I have to `git push origin main`.
