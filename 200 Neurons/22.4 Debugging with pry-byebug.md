## What is pry-byebug
Pry-byebug is the recommended gem for debugging as it includes Pry as a dependency adding step-by-step debugging and stack navigation.

## How to install it
1. Install the gem `gem install pry-byebug`.
2. Requesting the gem in the main script using `require 'pry-byebug`. 

## How to use it
By calling `binding.pry` at any point in the program.

## How it works
When the code reaches `binding.pry` an IRB-like session is open in the terminal from which I can check almost anything (variables, methods, etc.) for anything (variables, methods, etc.) within the scope binding currently is. 

In this example only `original_length` and `string_array` are within binding's scope. 
```ruby
require 'pry-byebug'

def isogram?(string)
  original_length = string.length
  string_array = string.downcase.split

  binding.pry

  unique_length = string_array.uniq.length
  original_length == unique_length
end

isogram?("Odin")
```

`exit!` to exit completely from the pry session, `exit` to keep running the program until the next breakpoint. 
### next
Though binding works under the current scope, with the `next` keyword (proper of byebug) I can step over and evaluate the next line. 

```ruby
require 'pry-byebug'

def yell_greeting(string)
  name = string

  binding.pry

  name = name.upcase
  greeting = "WASSAP, #{name}!"
  puts greeting
end

yell_greeting("bob")

```

Detail the binding now is **at the begging** of the line 11 (that line hasn't been evaluated yet); and calling the variable `name` now has the updated value of `BOB`

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> name
=> "bob"
[2] pry(main)> greeting
=> nil
[3] pry(main)> next

     5: def yell_greeting(string)
     6:   name = string
     7:
     8:   binding.pry
     9:
    10:   name = name.upcase
 => 11:   greeting = "WASSAP, #{name}!"
    12:   puts greeting
    13: end

[4] pry(main)> name
=> "BOB"


```
### ls
To see the methods and instance variables an object has access to.
