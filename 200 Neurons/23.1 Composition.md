[[13.1 OO Programming|OOP]]

Composition made possible objects to contain or be made of other objects (like a pc that contains the mother board, ram, etc.), or to build classes by embedding classes in other classes; composition creates a relationship between two classes, or better, two objects of two classes. Thus, one class will have one field/property of another class. One object has an instance of another object. 

>[!important]
>- The "has-a" object may not be able to exists standalone. Meaning, if I have a product class, price can't exists by its own. 
>- Composition allow to re-use that 'derived' class in other parts of the code base. 

This is extremely useful when a class needs to inherit from two classes, for example, a having a flying bird class and a swimming bird class, my duck class needs both. However they can inherit from only one, so I can use composition, and compose duck with both classes. 

To determine if something is a class or a property of a class, think on the has a relationship. If that thing has a relationship with the class, then use composition and make it a whole separated class. 
## Abstraction
>[!quote]
>Just as with inheritance, composition provides a mechanism for building objects. In fact, I would argue that there are only two ways to build classes from other classes: inheritance and composition.

## Has-a relationship
Composition is a 'has-a' relationship. When separating objects, for example a car from the engine, the car 'has a' car; I can't say the engine 'is-a' car, thus, there is no inheritance in composition.

This is another example

    this.userCRUD = new userCRUD ();
    this.reportGenerator = new reportGenerator ();
    this.userCommunication = new userCommunication();
