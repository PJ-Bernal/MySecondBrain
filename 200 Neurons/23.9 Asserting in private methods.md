Private methods of classes are usually called by other methods, public ones, so testing on private methods is not required. The test should use that public method, and its the public method job to invoke the private method. 

Making private method, public, for testing purposes breaks encapsulation. However, if I really need to test that private method, make its access modifier `internal` and set the `[InternalsVisible0 attribute]` in the assembly info file to the name of the test project assembly.
