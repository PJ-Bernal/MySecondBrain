[[12.6 Git and Github|Git and Github]]

## Commit
Captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes, though as 'safe' versions of a project. Here are some useful flags. 
### `-a --all`
Tell the command to automatically stage files that have been previously tracked. Untracked files won't be affected. Detail I can combine this flag with the `-m` flag, this will work only for tracked files.

>The files 'first' and 'second' weren't staged, thus the first `git commit -a -m` won't work; then first and second were staged and committed. After that, third was created and _modified,_, first was modified and second was deleted. Using again the command only commits first, delete second but third remain un-staged because it was a new file and hasn't been staged. 

### `-C <commit>`
Take an existing commit object, and reuse the log message and the authorship information (including the timestamp) when creating the commit.

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20231227145926 1.png]]
>Detail how the last commit has the same author, time stamp and log message. 

Useful to create a follow-up commit with similar or related changes. 
### `-c <commit>`
Like -C, but with -c the editor is invoked, so that the user can further edit the commit message. The only change is the nano or default editor is invoked, so I can modify the git log message.

### `-fixup`
[question:: analyze this later.]

### `--squash`
Use with `commit rebase -i <reduce commit hash-code>^` to combine multiple commits into one. The reduce hash-code has to be 'my main' commit, remember I can only squash files up the commit history, not down. 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20231227155511 1.png]]
>In this case I want to combine the first and second change of Z, so I use the command and squash (or simply s) the files I want to squash, leaving the original.

### `reset-author`
When used with -C/-c/--amend options, or when committing after a conflicting cherry-pick, declare that the authorship of the resulting commit now belongs to the committer. This also renews the author timestamp.
