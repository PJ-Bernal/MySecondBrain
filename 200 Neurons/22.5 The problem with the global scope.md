[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

The global scope for multiple JS files in an HTML file is **the same**. Therefore, I can do something like this.

![[Pasted image 20240903125138.png]]

The scripts are loaded one after another, so calling second before first will trigger an error. 

## ESM and the private scope
ES6 Modules or ESM solve this problem allowing what to export (exporting something doesn't automatically make it available elsewhere) an import (import has to be manually) and providing files with its own scope. 

This allow to pack the codebase in larger projects in big/small but organize chunks. Separating between private and public components of a module

>[!important]
>- Modules scope is not global scope, thus, a top-level variable in a module won't be accessible in the global scope.
>- I can use `as` to rename imports and export statements.

There are two ways to make exporting and importing, [[22.5 Named exports - imports|named]] and [[22.5 Default exports - imports|default]] exports/imports.

After the export keyword I can use let, var, const, function or class declarations. 

## Dealing with "invalid" exports and imports
When renaming, I can `as` using string literals, so I can use not valid identifiers. In this case, when importing, I will have to rename again to a valid identifier.

```js
// /modules/my-module.js
const a = 1;
export { a as "a-b" };
```

```js
import { "a-b" as a } from "/modules/my-module.js";
```

## Modify import values
When importing I can't re-assign bindings, only read them. 

## The problem with ESM
Modules have to deal with a performance issue the more module files the browser would have to download individually (especially as more third-party libraries). To solve this issue I can use [[22.5 About bundlers - the Webpack solution|bundlers]].
