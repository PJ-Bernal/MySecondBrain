[[12.6 Git and Github|Git and Github]]

Remember Git and GitHub are not the same. Git doesn't manage the remote repository, GitHub does. 

## Add a remote origin
[question:: What is a remote origin and why I want to add that to my Git]
Being in Git I can use a command like this to add a remote origin (the URL, in this case is an https). Detail the flags:

- add: add a new remote. I can have several remotes joined to my repository.
- origin: given name to that repository, the standard is 'origin'. 

## Review remote sources added to the repository
Use `git remote -v`, that will output something like this.

Fetch and push clarifies from where I'm obtained and pushed the data. In some cases I could use a different repository for obtaining the data. But, most of the time the push and fetch will be the same. 

`git push -u origin master`
- origin: name of the repository the information is to be sent. 
- master: branch name the information is to be sent. 
- -u: for next pushes, the branch doesn't have to be specified; like stablish master branch per default. 
## Caching GitHub credentials in Git
To remember credentials when cloning using `HTTPS`, follow [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git#platform-linux).
