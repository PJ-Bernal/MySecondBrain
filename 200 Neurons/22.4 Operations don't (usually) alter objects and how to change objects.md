[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Operations don't change the object state, in this case, Ruby makes a copy of the object referred to by `x`, so the variable `y` is using that copy. 

```ruby
x = "hello"
y = x + " world"

puts y
#=> hello world

puts x   
#=> hello
```

The += effectively reassigns tom to a new object. That new object is the sum of what tom used to point to and the string "kat".

```ruby
tom = "kitty"
jerry = tom
tom += "kat"

puts jerry   
#=> kitty

puts tom   
#=> kittykat
```

## How to alter an object state
I can alter one single object state making operations to itself. This is useful to keep working on the same variable, and make code more readable. 

```ruby
x = "hello"
x = x + " dolly"

puts x   
#=> hello dolly
```

This is done by making a copy of the object referred to by `x`. 

```ruby
x = [the result of x + " dolly"]
```

### Object arguments can change 
If you call a method that mutates the caller or arguments, it will change the value in that object's address space, and any other variables that also point to that object will be affected.


```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3, 3]
b = a
c = a.uniq
a # [1, 2, 3, 3]
b # [1, 2, 3, 3]
c # [1, 2, 3]
c = a.uniq!
a # [1, 2, 3]
b # [1, 2, 3]
c # [1, 2, 3]
```

### Using variables as arguments to a method
This is equivalent to executing b = a. Inside the method, the operations we perform on the b variable determine whether the value of a will change. So, inside the method I can modify the object.

```rubydef test(b)
  b.map {|letter| "I like the letter: #{letter}"}
end

a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
test(a)
```
