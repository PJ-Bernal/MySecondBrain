[[12.12 React|React]]

```jsx
// App.jsx

import { useState } from "react";

const App = () => {
  const [heading, setHeading] = useState("Magnificent Monkeys");

  const clickHandler = () => {
    setHeading("Radical Rhinos");
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={clickHandler}>
        Click Me
      </button>
      <h1>{heading}</h1>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

```jsx
// App.test.jsx

import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";
import App from "./App";

describe("App component", () => {
  it("renders magnificent monkeys", () => {
    // since screen does not have the container property, we'll destructure render to obtain a container for this test
    const { container } = render(<App />);
    expect(container).toMatchSnapshot();
  });

  it("renders radical rhinos after button click", async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();

    render(<App />);
    const button = screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Click Me" });

    await user.click(button); // **

    expect(screen.getByRole("heading").textContent).toMatch(/radical rhinos/i);
  });
});
```

To simulate user interactions import the `UserEvent` library, and then create a 'virtual user' that will interact with the component. The `setup()` method will simulate user interactions, and all the results are stored in a user constant that can trigger events. Is **recommended** to invoke the setup before rendering the component, and don't render or use the user outside of the test. 

Then use `render()` to create the browser environment to put the component with its initial state.

The component has a button for the user to interact with, thus., use the `getByRole` query to gran the button. The accessible name of this button is Click me. 

`userEvents` handles interactions async to better mirror real user behavior. This line (`*`) fires the event click, run the `clickhandler` function, updating the state, and re-render the component.

After the component is updated, for the last part, first I grab the updated element, and get the text inside of it, and finally use the match method when `/i` will use case insensitivity. 

The expect method returns a special object, not a boolean, called expectation that contains certain matchers that either passes silently or throws an error.
