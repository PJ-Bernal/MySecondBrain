# Call stack window
A break mode could be nested in several code calls, for example, the entry point first line, calls a method, that creates an object, and then, the constructor of that object, calls another method, etc.

To keep track of the method stack, debug menu -> windows -> call stack window (ctrl + alt + C)

Read from bottom to top.

Clicking on each line will bring the editor to that method, but the yellow arrow is still.
