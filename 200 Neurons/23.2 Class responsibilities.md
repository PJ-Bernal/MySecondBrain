## Identifying class responsibilities
Identifying the responsibilities is the really first step of creating classes. The main resources are the verbs in the use cases and user stories. Remember, the action is applied to the noun that is changed or responding to the action, even though almost all the actions are caused by the actor, that doesnâ€™t mean the actor becomes a class with all the methods.

As with objects, some of the verbs can be deleted, replaces, split, etc. But this is a good starting point. 

>[!info] Where should a behavior live? or whose reponsibility is it?

To begin identifying the responsibilities, list the objects (with its relationships) and the verbs and then related the verbs with the objects.

- Although the system spawn the spaceship, the spaceship object has the responsibility for creating itself and estabalish its location. 
- move = flies towards player. Spawn (missile) = fires missile. Move (asteroid) = move. Detect collision (misile or asteroid) = avoid misile. Move (missile) = flies past player. Out of bounds (missile) = disapear offscreen. 

A single responsibility could be assigned to several objects, like detect collision. At this point, try to assign as best the responsibility, but that could be corrected later. 

>[!warning] Objects with no responsibilities
>Detail the player doesn't have a single responsibility, this isn't wrong as the conceptual object model shows who initiates the action but where the responsibility lies in performing them. The player will be requesting behaviors of other objects. 

>[!warning] Common mistakes
>1. assing multiple responsibilities to a single or important actor, with the excuse of 'that actor drives the encounter'. In OOP, and object that does or knows to much is know as the god object. 
>2. Create a god object. A clear example is the creation of a system object (this is not necesarily bad) and overchange it with a huge amount of responsabilities (this is a mistake).

>>Seeing things like this in a user story or use case in which the word system is a noun (thus, a possible object) means some part (not the system), does something.

>>So create a god object is not the solution, although, of course the application should have some kind of system in it. This way of thinking is for a procedural programmer. Remember responsibilities should distributes among objects, not store in one god object.

### Noun analysis hints

## CRC cards
Class, Responsibility, Colaboration (other colaborative classes), (or Component, Responsibilites and Helper), card contain the same information as the conceptual model diagram, in another format. Each card represents one class and contains three sections: class name, responsibilities and collaborators. 

I don't have to be techincal, so don't think in method names here, just simple self-explicable sentenses.

Using physical cards is more useful to use a tech tool in this stage as I will tend to move and see more clearly associations, and if I need more than one card for a class, thats a clear indicator a clas might be redesing as it has much resposibilities.
