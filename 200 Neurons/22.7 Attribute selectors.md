>An attribute is anything inside the opening tag of an HTML element, so classes and IDs are also attributes. 

Attribute selectors have the same specificity as classes and pseudo-classes. I can use any of an element's attributes as selectors. By default, attribute selectors are case-sensitive. 

## Seven ways to use attribute selectors
```css
[data-value] {
  /* Attribute exists */
}

[data-value="foo"] {
  /* Attribute has this exact value */
}

[data-value*="art"] {
  /* Attribute value contains this value somewhere in it. For example, img[alt*="art"] will select images with the alt text “abstract art” and “athlete starting a new sport”, because the value “art” is in the word “starting”. */
}

[data-value~="art"] {
  /* Attribute has this value in a space-separated list somewhere. For example, img[alt~="art"] will select images with the alt text “abstract art” and “art show”, but not “athlete starting a new sport” (which the “contains” selector would select). */
}

[data-value^="foo"] {
  /* Attribute value starts with this */
}

[data-value|="foo"] {
  /* Attribute value starts with this in a dash-separated list.  For example, li[data-years|="1900"] will select list items with a data-years value of “1900-2000”, but not the list item with a data-years value of “1800-1900” */
}

[data-value$="foo"] {
  /* Attribute value ends with this.  For example, a[href$="pdf"] selects every link that ends with .pdf. */
}
```

## Case insensitive matching
The selector is case insensitive adding a `i` before the closing bracket.

```css
[attribute="value" i] {
  /* Styles here will apply to elements with:
    attribute="value"
    attribute="VaLuE"
    attribute="VALUE"
    ...etc
  */
}
```

## Combine any other selector with attribute selectors
```css
div[attribute="value"] {
  /* style rules here */
}

img[src] {
  /* This will only target img elements that have a src attribute. */
}

.module[attribute="value"] {
  /* style rules here */
}

#header[attribute="value"] {
  /* style rules here */
}
```
