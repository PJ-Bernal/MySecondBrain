[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

The framework is compose of the Core and other frameworks of ASP.NET Core, combined.

# The Core, the ASP.NET Core platform 
Contains the more low-level features. This includes the code that receive the request and create the responses, but middleware, the integrated kestrel server and more.  

# Application frameworks
On top of the Core platform, are the application frameworks. Most of the code written will use those frameworks, rather than the Core ASP.NET Core platform. However, I canâ€™t use any application platform without using the ASP.NET Core platform. 

Concepts are shared between frameworks, thus, learning one or another is simple. 
# Other frameworks
-	Entity framework: to interact with databases.
-	Identity: log in features. 
-	gRPC: high performance RPC services.
