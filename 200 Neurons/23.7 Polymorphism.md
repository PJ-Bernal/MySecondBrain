# About polymorphism
It allows a derived class method to have its own implementation, overriding the base class method. 

The base class should indicate the inheriting type can have its own implementation using the keywords virtual and override.

# Creating override methods
The virtual keyword in the parent's class indicates the implementation of a method could be different in inherited types, thus, if a derived method has its own implementation, and the parent class method signature's has virtual, then, the compiler **will use** the override method.

The override keyword allow to provide a different implementation of a virtual method.

# Using polymorphism 
Thanks to this override feature, the code can reference an instance of a derived type through a base type reference. 

Detail, both variables are the type employee that hold a reference (in the heap) to a manager/researcher classes. Thanks to this, because the variable is the type employee, the variable can now invoke members of the employee class. This is a [[23.7 Inheritance#About the is-a relatioship|problem]] that have plain inheritance.

However, thanks to poly, the most specific version, the override version, will be called. Thus, if the manager class has a override method define, the variable will call that method. Doing this allow me to use the most 'updated' method version. 

In this case, e1 can't access this method because its unknown for the Employee type.

![[23.7 Inheritance#^4e5e68]]

Poly will allow to group objects under a same parent class, and then execute a method in all off them. For example, group objects of different instances, and then loop through them to execute a common method present in the parent class.

# Using override in VS
When having a virtual method, type override on the derived class, and VS will show a tool tip with all the virtual methods.
