[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

## The basic building blocks - statements
>[!multi-column]
>
>A statement is a building block that begins with any non-space characters and ends at the first closing brace or semicolon
>
>![[Pasted image 20240131112403.png|center|300]]

There are three types of statements:

>[!info]- Rulesets or rules
>See explanation below. 

>[!info]- At-rules
>Set of encapsulate rules with their own internal syntax and semantics that tell CSS how to behave under specific conditions. They must be place on the top of the style sheet, and start with `@`. [This](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-at-rules-and-why-use-of-at-in-css/) website explains at rules with clear examples. 

>[!info]- Nested statements
>[[22.7 Nested statements]]

## Rules
>[!multi-column]
>
>A ruleset or rule is the bundle of two parts: selector (determine the element to style) and a declaration block (with one or more CSS properties following the syntax `property: value;`). 
>>[!warning]
>>If one single selector is invalid within the selector list, the whole selector is invalid and the entire rule is ignored.

>[!info]- What happen when one element is target by several selectors?
>CSS standard defines which one has precedence over the other and must be applied: this is called the [cascade](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance) algorithm.

## Whitespace handling
>[!multi-column]
>
>![[Pasted image 20240221205119.png|center|120]]
>
>Insensitive to whitespace between and within rules, thus, any whitespace is collapsed to a single space for parsing purposes. 
>%% %%
>All of this examples are valid, but the first is an example of a minified CSS in which all the whitespace is removed, usually by an automated server-side script.

## Comments
Use `/* */` for comments. They can be multi-line and can not be nested. 

>[!info]
>Comments are totally ignored by the CSS parsers, they don't even count as whitespace, so I can put comments even in the middle of rules or inside declarations.

```css
/*This is a multi line
comment example*/

h1{
  color: /* Im inside a declaration*/ green; 
}
```
