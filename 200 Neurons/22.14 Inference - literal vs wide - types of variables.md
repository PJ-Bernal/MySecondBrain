JS is a [[22.5 Dynamic and weakly type|weak and dynamic]], but TS is strong and has static types for all kinds of bindings. The strong and static behavior are infer during compilation time by TS. 

This infer mechanism work like that with number, string and boolean types. Objects and arrays use a more complex inferred mechanism. 

There are two types of inferences.
### Literal

>```

Happens when declaring a constant, in which the inference is not attached to a value type, but **directly to a value**. Thus, when hovering, VSCode shows the inferred 'type' of the variable is the value attached to it. 

This is helpful because TS will know the binding can't be reassigned to any other value after initialization. And add an extra layer of type checking in certain scenarios.

In the example, `direction` is not inferred as a string type but as a the value `left`, therefore, the function parameters can be value (and not type) checked. 
### Wide

Happens with let or var declarations when the variable can be reassigned after declaration, so the variable is infer to a value type and **not to a value**. 
>[!blank-container|float-right-small]
>```js
>let age = 30;
>age = 20; // 
>```

The example don't trigger an error because the variable is infer as a number type and not to the `30` value.

## Inference and properties/methods

If a variable is correctly infer, the VSCode autocomplete should show the available methods/properties for that object.

If something happen with the inference mechanism, using the dot notation to use a method/property that is not own by the object will trigger an error.

## Writing a type on variable
Is not require to define the type of a variable when being declared, generally, is more valuable rely on the TS inference mechanism. 

Is beneficial to define a value type for function parameters and return values, when using complex objects or arrays, when the inferences process is to complex for TS or when creating a public API interface (declaration serves as documentation).
