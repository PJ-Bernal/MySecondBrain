[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

The configuration in this file avoid to type certain flags and make the process a bit faster. 

`tsc --init` creates the `tsconfig.json`, some of the recommended compiler options are:
- `"outDir": "./<any folder I want to transpile my TS code>"`, in the example I use `js`, so: `"outDir": "./js"`.

# Create a task 
Open the command pallet and write task -> configure any task -> create task.json -> other -> a task.json file is created.

Then click the debug tab and create a launch.json file -> Node. Then add the folder where the TS will be transpiled.

The `prelaunchtask` makes sure the task gets compiled before Node attempts to run it.
