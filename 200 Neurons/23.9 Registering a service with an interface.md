To fully implement DI, the implementation of a service must be handled outside of the class that needs it, through an interface

# Creating the services
To quickly create an interface, right click onto the service class name -> quick actions and refactorings -> extract interface -> complete window, selecting the desired methods.

This is the service

This is the automatic created interface

For example, this is another implementation of the mail service, this time, for cloud. Detail is another new class under the services folder.

# Register the service in program
Instead of provide a direct service, there's an overloads for the `addTransient` method providing an interface and a (implementation) concrete type. 

In this case, whenever the container inject `IMailService` in the code, the instance provided will be the `LocalMailService` type.

# Instantiate the service in the controller
Same as always. Create a backing field whose type will be the interface of the service, and the use constructor injection to create an instance, to be able to use it through the controller class.
