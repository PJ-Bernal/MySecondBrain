[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

The `transform` property can take one or more CSS functions as values. Almost all elements can have a `transform` property except `<col>`, `<colgroup>` and non-replaced elements (like `<span>`, `<b>` or `<em>`) or inline elements. 

>[!important]
>Once an element is in-flow position (position determined by the css layout algorithms like flebox, grid or normal flow), any transform happens in a separate layer, after the main layout has been calculated, therefore, any css algorithm ignore and are not affected by this property.

```css
.wrap > :first-child {
    transform: translateX(65px);
    background-color: gray;
    border: 2px solid blue;
}
```

## Why transform is so useful
Transformed elements are **not** removed from the normal flow (thus, Its original space in the layout is preserved) of the page but render **in their own** layer, therefore, they don't affect the rendering of the document flow. These layers allow the browser to update and redraw the transformed element independently of other content, which can significantly improve performance, especially for animations.

A transform element is treat as a flat image. Thus, using transform is useful for animations. Think the layer as a plane I can shrink easily. On the contrary, changing the width of a single element, require all the algorithms to re-run to figure out the adequate space, then pain and composite. Transform skip some stages of the pixel pipeline.

## Chain transformations
To chain separate the functions with a blank space. Chain transformations are applied from right to left. 

```html
<div class="red-box"></div>
<div class="blue-box"></div>
```

>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```css
>.red-box,
>.blue-box {
>  position: absolute;
>  width: 100px;
>  height: 100px;
>}
>
>.red-box {
>  background: red;
>  transform: rotate(45deg) translate(200%);
>}
>
>.blue-box {
>  background: blue;
>  transform: translate(200%) rotate(45deg);
>}
>```

The blue box rotates 45 degrees on the spot, then translates on the X axis by 200%, moving it directly to the right. 


First, rotate on the same spot, then move 100px
