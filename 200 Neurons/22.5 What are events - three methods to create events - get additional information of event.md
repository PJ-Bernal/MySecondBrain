## What are events?
An event is an action that occurs in the web browser, which the web browser feedbacks to you so that you can respond to it, such as mouse-clicks or key-presses. ([Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/auxclick_event) is a list with all browser events. [Here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_eventattributes.asp) is a list of all HTML attribute events ). 

I can respond to this events with an event handler (know as well as event listener) which is a block of code that will execute when the event occurs, as properties. For example, mouse is an event, but has several properties like button, clientX, etc. [Check this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/button). 

Events happens in nodes, so when creating the `document.querySelector()`, think on the element the event will be applied to. For example, in [[22.5 Mouse events#Getting screen coordinates|this]] example, the mouse perse doesn't have a class, but I'm selecting the div, that in this, is the element that is receiving the event (the mouse movement).

## How to create events
### Method 1
You can specify function attributes directly on your HTML elements. Less preferred method as I clutter the HTML with JS. 

```javascript
<button onclick="alert('Hello World')">Click Me</button>
```
### Method 2
You can set properties in the form of `on<eventType>`, is an HTML attribute event handler, such as `onclick` or `onmousedown`, on the DOM nodes in your JavaScript.

```HTML
<!-- the HTML file -->
<button id="btn">Click Me</button>
```

```javascript
// the JavaScript file
const btn = document.querySelector("#btn");
btn.onclick = () => alert("Hello World"); // This is a classic arrow function
```

### Method 3
You can attach event listeners to the DOM nodes in your JavaScript (preferred method, because I can attach several events handlers to the same element), using a JS event performed.

In this method, the `addEventListener()` register an event handler (a callback in this case, but I can use a user defined function or anonymous functions). This example is using an arrow function. 

```HTML
<!-- the HTML file -->
<button id="btn">Click Me Too</button>
```

```javascript
// the JavaScript file
const btn = document.querySelector("#btn");
btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Hello World");
});
```

This is the preferred method because allow to add multiple event listeners if required (the first two methods only allow to have one event listener of the same type).

>[!important]
>All the examples use arrow functions with no argument, but of course I can use user declared functions. If the function is complex or has multiple lines, this is a better choice. 

>[!error]
>In the examples above I use `const` to obtain the DOM element, in the other notes of this topic the examples use `let`, but is better the former as I prevent the variable be alter unintentionally later in the script.

## Get additional information about the event
The parameter of the arrow/anonymous function, `e` in this example, references the object `Event` itself that is being handled by the event listener, and I can use it to access properties and methods related to the event; **all events have multiple properties** that also can contain other properties; for example, the target property of the click event have multiple properties, one is called id that returns the id of the element.

. In this example, `e` is referencing the `click` event, so to see all the properties and methods I ca do this:

```js
btn.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  console.dir(e);
});
```

>[!important]
>The event has to be trigger in order to execute the anonymous function and get the information. In this image, I click the text box and press a key.

Remember the instances of `Event` (in this case the parameter `e` is an instance) have access to all properties and methods of `Event.prototype`. 

```html
<button id="btn">CLICK ME BABY</button>
```

```js
btn.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  console.log(e.target);
});
// <button id="btn"></button>

btn.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  e.target.style.background = "blue";
});
// Turn the background of the button blue
```
