[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

This is the basic syntax for the while loop looks like:

```javascript
initializer
while (condition) {
  // code to run

  final-expression
}
```

And for do... while. Remember that the code executed within the do... while is executed at least once.  

```javascript
initializer
do {
  // code to run

  final-expression
} while (condition)
```

>[!important]
>- Both of this conditions resolve to a boolean and the loop stops when false; so a raw comparison is not needed. 
>- An expression within the code that change the comparison operand must be included, otherwise the loop will be running for ever. 

```javascript
let i = 3;
while (i) { // when i becomes 0, the condition becomes falsy, and the loop stops
  alert( i );
  i--;
}
```

When using a single statement, curly braces are not required. 

```javascript
let i = 3;
while (i) alert(i--);
```
