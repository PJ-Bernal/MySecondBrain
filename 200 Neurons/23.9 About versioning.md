# About versioning
There are several ways of version API:
- URI version: `https://root/api/v1/authors`, `https://root/api/v2/authors`, etc.
- URI via query string parameter: `https://root/api/authors?version=v1`
- Custom header: `X-version: "v1"`
- Acceptance header: `Accept: "application/json; version=v1"`
- Media types: `Accept: "applicaation/vnd.marving.book.v1+json"`

Which one to use depends on the case and design of the API. 

A popular way of version is using the `Asp.Versioning.Mvc` package, and then implement a way, the notes will use the uri version. 

# Adding versioning to the api
First, disable the authentication, by commenting the `[Authentication]` attributes in the controller. Then add the package. 
## Register the service in the container
Use `.AddApiVersioning()`, and configure it:
- `ReportApiVersions`: allow the versioning services to return the version over the source to easily see which version we're getting back.
