[[12.12 React|React]]

- Start with type, if I need to group things, use interface. 
## When to use interfaces
- For objects used in multiple places whose properties (not its values) are not going to mutate, and define a clear state
- When making an extension
- When the shape of the data is important for the business logic
- For API or components props

```jsx
// Good use of interface - defines a clear shape for props
interface PlayerProps {
  name: string;
  score: number;
  onScoreChange: (newScore: number) => void;
}

// when extending
interface BasicGameState {
  isActive: boolean;
  score: number;
}

interface AdvancedGameState extends BasicGameState {
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  timeLimit: number;
}
```

## When to use types
- Unions and intersections
- Simples state shapes
- Function types

```jsx
// Good use of type for union
type GameStatus = 'idle' | 'playing' | 'paused' | 'finished';

// Good use of type for intersection
type AdminUser = User & AdminPrivileges;

type CursorPosition = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

type GameCallback = (score: number) => void;
```

After defining the interfaces and types, all must be initialized. 

## When let TS to determine the types
- WHen the type is obvios
- When the data type can mutate in the code development at some point. If this happens, probably I'll need to update my code in several places.

## Typing events and function parameters
Events must be always typed as they help with the autocompletition, same with function parameters

```jsx
const handleInput = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {}
```

## as const
If I want to make a return value a type, use as const

```jsx
	const initialCharStatuses = selectedPara.split('').map(char => ({
      char,
      status: 'untyped' as const // Use 'as const' to narrow the type
    }));
```
