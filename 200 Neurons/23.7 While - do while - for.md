# While
Same syntax as always. The boolean expression is tested before the loop runs, meaning, after the first execution, if something change the expression to false, then, the boolean expression will be tested before, and the while statements won't execute. 

```c#
while(boolean expressions)
{
  // statemenets
}
```

# Do - while
Same syntax as always:

```c#
do{
  // statements
} while ();
```

# For
```c#
for(initialization; boolean statement; iterator)
{
  // statemenets
}
```
