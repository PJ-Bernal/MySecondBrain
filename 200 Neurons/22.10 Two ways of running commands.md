[[12.10 Docker|Docker]]

There are two ways to run commands, both are accepted to keep retro compatibility with the CLI. One way is `docker container run` and the other is `docker run`, this is the 'old' one. 

```docker
docker container run -dp 80:80 docker/getting-started
docker run -dp 80:80 docker/getting-started
```
