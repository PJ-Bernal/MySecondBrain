[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

Closures, FF and the module pattern provide a way to encapsulate values, code or anything, providing a selective access to the things inside that unit. This is what modules are about, that leads to a technique called namespacing, to avoid naming collisions in my codebase. 

Take the [[22.5 FF additional uses - grouping or encapsulate code - the module pattern -  IIFE|calculator example]] into consideration. Itâ€™s very easy to imagine a scenario where you can accidentally create multiple functions with the name add. What does add do - does it add two numbers? Strings? Does it take its input directly from the DOM and display the result? What would you name the functions that do these things? Instead, we can easily encapsulate them inside a module called calculator which generates an object with that name, allowing us to explicitly call calculator.add(a, b) or calculator.sub(a, b).
