Some controller can use information about the user, in which the user role is check and depending on the role, the user is redirected to another action. 

![[Pasted image 20250305110721.png]]

The test will check the behavior of this action, so I need a user object with a role claim. 

Again, the controller class is dependent on two attributes, so first build those to have an instance of the controller to be able to invoke the action  method in the act.

![[Pasted image 20250305111146.png]]

In the test.

Then, see the action method implementation to see what that method needs. It needs a user, so I need to create that with a list of claims.

![[Pasted image 20250305111327.png]]

From the claims, create claims identity passing the unit test claims as the authentication type. And from the claims identity create a claims principal, because the user object in the controller is of that type.

Then, create an http context instance. This example will ue the default http context, though I can use a mock.

![[Pasted image 20250305112433.png]]

Then pass the context to the controller by setting in on the controller context.

![[Pasted image 20250305112511.png]]

Then act.

For assert, detail the action result I action result, I can cast directly to the actual resulting type. This first part check if I'm dealing with an action result. it is an interface, so I can't use Is type, but is assignable from. 

![[Pasted image 20250305112642.png]]

Or I also can check if I'm dealing with the expected type, this approach is better because is more specific. Finally assert.

# Using mocks
Start creating a mock principal. This is another test but using mocks.

![[Pasted image 20250305112928.png]]

Create a mocks principal. in this case the mock return true if the role of an admin is true. 

![[Pasted image 20250305112949.png]]

Then create an http context mock.

![[Pasted image 20250305113048.png]]

And then pass the appropriate context to the context controller.

![[Pasted image 20250305113120.png]]

Act and assert are the same.
