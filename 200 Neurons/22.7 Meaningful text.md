## Links
When using an `a` element:
- The text wrap by the element must be meaningful, telling where the link redirects. Don't use 'click here' or 'this page', but', the odin project website', for example.
- If a link open or download a file, or opens a new tab, indicate that to the user.

```html
<!-- Example 1: Now the user is aware that this link will open or download a PDF file. -->
<a href='...'>2021 Sign Up Statistics (PDF, 1MB)</a>

<!-- Example 2: And now the user knows this link opens in a new tab! -->
<a href='...'>GitHub (opens in new tab)</a>

```

Also, always alter the user when opening a new link, with a symbol ![[Pasted image 20241010122230.png|70]] 
## Forms
When showing errors, the content must indicate the type of error.

```html
<!-- Example 1: Huh? -->
<div class='input-error'>Error: Invalid input.</div>

<!-- Example 2: That makes more sense. -->
<div class='input-error'>Error: Email is invalid.</div>

<!-- Example 3: Even better! -->
<div class='input-error'>Error: 'JohnSmith@@test.com' is not valid. Example of a valid email: example@yourdomain.com.</div>
```

Another way to improve this is by adding instructions next to the inputs when the instruction is specific, or at the top of the form.

## Alternative text
When an image is decorative or not important, the `alt` content should be empty; if the alt attribute is missing, the presence of the image could still be announced, which may be confuse the user. 

For images, don't include phrases like 'image of' or 'graphic of' as screen readers already announce 'graphic'. The `alt` must include the content and the functionality.
