# About C#
C# is a general-purpose language with enough balance between power and ease of use (not much control so things can go wrong, not little control by removing me some power). 

Some C# features include:

>[!multi-column]
>
>>Statically typed.
>Garbage collected.
>
>>Object oriented programming.
>Imperative.
>Functional programming.
>
>>Event-driven.
>Dynamic typing.
>Unmanaged code.

# About .NET
Called either framework or platform, is a whole ecosystem in which C# programs run through a runtime. Its extremely capable taking a lot of burden from the developer. It includes:

>[!important]- Base Class library (BCL)
>Which is a pile of ready-to-use code. For example, there's no need to hard code how to open a file or compute a square root.

>[!important]- Software Development Kit (SDK)
>Extra pile of ready-to-use code to make code smoother.

>[!important]- Platform-specific features
>Include additional help for web, mobile and desktop applications.
