# About struct
Structs represents a custom data structure, lightweight, with limited amount of data. Behind the scenes, a struct is a value type. It can be instantiated with `new`, but is not necessary as it's a value type. 

Think of structs as 'lightweight' classes. They are created on the stack, not the heap, meaning a struct is a value type. 

# Creating a struct
Use the `struct` keyword. Then add fields and method members. Right click on the project -> add -> new item -> class, there's no template for structs.

# Using the struct
Because its a value type, new is not required.
