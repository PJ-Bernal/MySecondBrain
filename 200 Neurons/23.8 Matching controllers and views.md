# Matching controllers and view
For each controller in the folder, a corresponding view subfolder is created.

![[Pasted image 20250120120758.png|center|450]]

If this convention is followed, action methods will know [[23.8 Controller#^778847|which view]] to display. If the view can't be found, an exception is thrown.
