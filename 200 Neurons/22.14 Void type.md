# Void in callbacks
In the context of TS, when using void as a return value for a callback is the same as saying I don't care if the callback has a return value or not, it could be anything. Is different from undefine which is the default return value of a function without a return value.

Now, undefined is a subset of void, this is why a void function

Don't create variables of type void. Void only has meaning in the context of the return value of a function.

The second function is saying: I accept a function as a callback of any return type, and please ignore it. Its quite different from: I'm a function that should not return anything.

>Is quite different when I use void in a user define function as when I use it to defined a callback. In the first example, the callback doesn't care of any return value, the return value is not being use in the callback. In a function the function does care about the return value.
