[[13.4 Linux]]

>Software that resides in the memory and is the core of the operating system that tells the CPU where to look for its next task. Act as a mediator and manages the hardware (especially main memory), is the primary interface between the hardware and any running program, and handles a variety of low-level operations in a privileged running mode ([[22.4 Kernel space|Kernel space]])

Also, it splits the main memory into subdivisions to keep certain constant state information at all times. Each process gets its own share of memory, and the kernel must ensure that each process keeps to its share.
