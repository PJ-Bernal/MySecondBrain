# Entities
Two entities are added.

# Db context
Now, insisde of the db context, the class tracks both entities and expose them as db sets.

Then some dummy data is created, about the authors and courses.

Finally, add that to allow sqlite can work with datatime offsets. 

# Controllers
All controller classes interact with the db context through a repo.

Detail the controller depends on the repo.

Detail entity classes are not exposes, instead, dtos are exposed in the model classes. The entity model is different from a DTO.

Also auto mapper is used to map between entities and DTOs.

# Program cs
Two extension methos were created. the configure servives and pipeline.

## Configure services
The add controllers services allow to work with controllers. 

![[Pasted image 20250203164452.png]]

The class use the ConfigurePipeline method to set p the pipeline.

## Reset database async of program.cs
That ensure the db is recreated whenever the app is started. 

This is not good for rea life, but is fine for testing locally. if data is corrupted the db is reset on each run.
