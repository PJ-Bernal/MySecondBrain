# About authorization policies
The [[23.9 Using information from the token in a controller|past note]] require to add a method to the repo, then the interface and invoked from within the controller, but is better to create an authorization layer, so the request must pass there before entering an action. 

Policies defines complex rules in regards authorization, they can use the users claims to allow or not allow certain actions; for example only admins can create or delete resources. 

ABAC that means attribute-based access control. CBAC claims-based access control, and PBAC policy-based access control, all three are the same.

ASP-NET Core has built-in support to create authorization policies. 

The above is an alternative fro RBAC, role-based access control, the ABAC is the preferred approach nowadays. 

# Creating authorization policies
In the program class, use `AddAuthorization` in the services collection. Then use add policy on the options object. The first parameter is the policy name.

## Policy requirements
Only when all are T, the policy is met.

In this case, I require and authenticated user and, then use the require claim to request to match a specific claim, in this case, the city must be antwerp. Another example could be `policy.RequireClaim("admin", "true");`

Is not a goof practice to hard-code the policies, so create a class inside of the api directory called AuthConstants.

This is better to avoid hard coded policies.

## Conditional policy
If I want a conditional policy.

# Using the policy in the controller
Pass the policy name to the authorize attribute, that policy will apply to all those action inside the controller. 

The og code

Add the policy

## Using the policy at granular level
Some policies apply to some actions, for example, only admins can create, so delete the Authorize header and add it to the required action methods. In this example the name of the policy is Admin.

Remember to use the constants

# Testing
Manually, change the token city claim to other thing.

![[Pasted image 20250128104500.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250128104508.png]]

Then get a new token

![[Pasted image 20250128104532.png]]

Copy the token.

Now, this token should not allow to execute ANY of the action methods in the controller, in this case for example, I want to create a poi.

![[Pasted image 20250128104619.png]]

Then change the authorizataion 

![[Pasted image 20250128104636.png]]

Send it and 403, because Im authenticated, but I dont have access. 401 is that Im not even authenticated.

![[Pasted image 20250128104703.png]]

Changing the city to antwerp adn create the poi grants a 201. remember the authorizatio is bearer, paste the token and the body

Detail, the claims are pass in the payload, and not in a class like the above. review why the claims are in that class instead of in the payload.
