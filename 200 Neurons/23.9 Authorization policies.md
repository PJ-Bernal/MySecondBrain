# About authorization policies
The [[23.9 Using information from the token in a controller|past note]] require to add a method to the repo, then the interface and invoked from within the controller, but is better to create an authorization layer, so the request must pass there before entering an action. 

Policies defines complex rules in regards authorization, they can use the users claims to allow or not allow certain actions; ABAC that means attribute-based access control. CBAC claims-based access control, and PBAC policy-based access control, all three are the same.

ASP-NET Core has built-in support to create authorization policies. 

The above is an alternative fro RBAC, role-based access control, the ABAC is the preferred approach nowadays. 

# Creating authorization policies
In the program class, use `AddAuthorization` in the services collection. Then use add policy on the options object. The first parameter is the policy name.

## Policy requirements
Only when all are T, the policy is met.

In this case, I require and authenticated user and, then use the require claim to request to match a specific claim, in this case, the city must be antwerp. 

# Using the policy in the controller
Pass the policy name to the authorize attribute, that policy will apply to all those action inside the controller. 

The og code

Add the policy

# Testing
Manually, change the token city claim to other thing.

Then get a new token

![[Pasted image 20250128104532.png]]

Copy the token.

Now, this token should not allow to execute ANY of the action methods in the controller, in this case for example, I want to create a poi.

Then change the authorizataion 

![[Pasted image 20250128104636.png]]

Send it and 403, because Im authenticated, but I dont have access. 401 is that Im not even authenticated.

![[Pasted image 20250128104703.png]]

Changing the city to antwerp adn create the poi grants a 201. remember the authorizatio is bearer, paste the token and the body
