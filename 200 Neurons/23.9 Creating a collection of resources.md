# The problem
How to create a list of resources in one go. 

Because there doesn't have to be a direct mapping between the entities in the db and the outer-facing contract, a totally resource can interact with a db table.

To achieve problems like this, stops thinking everything as entities, but resources. 

# Resource vs entity
A resource is an abstract concept that represents an object or data that the API exposes. A database entity is a concrete representation of data stored in a database.

# Create a new controller
There's a new resource involve, so is better to have a separate controller.

The method's parameter is an `IEnumerable` of `AuthorForCreationDto`, instead of a single `AuthorForCreationDto`.

Then, map the collection to an IEnum of entities.  Then add them to the data store via repo, adding them in the context, this code doesn't execute any sql statement to make the data persistent. 

Only when saveAsync is executed that the sql is executed and stored in the db.

To return use the created at route, remember this method return a location header, but what is the URI to get this collection? 

To do that go to the next note.
