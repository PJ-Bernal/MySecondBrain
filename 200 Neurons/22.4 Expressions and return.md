[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

 When you type something in at the irb prompt you are creating an expression. An expression is anything that can be evaluated, and pretty much everything you write in Ruby is an expression. An expression in Ruby **always** returns something, even if that's an error message or nil.

The returns statements are seen by Ruby, but no by the user. 

In this example, both loops are returning something, but only the second is showing something in the screen.
