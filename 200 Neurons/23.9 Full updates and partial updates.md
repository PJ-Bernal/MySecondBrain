# About PUT and PATCH
When using PUT for full updates, all fields of the resources are either overwritten or set to their default values. The payload must represent the resource to update, and also include all fields; missing fields are set to their default values. The response of a PUT could be an updated author or an empty response. 

When using PATCH for partial updates, the URI is the same as PUT but the request payload is a `JsonPatchDocument`, which is a set of changes to include in the resource.  The response payload can be an updated author or empty. The media type for patch is `application/json-patch+json`.

# The patch document
The patch document is an array `[]` with a list of operations to apply on the resource. The path property could be any DTO property, but not the entity of model properties. When working with DTO classes remove means return the property to its default value.

A request is successful when all operations can be apply.

> Path doesn't have to be a simple property, and value doesn't have to be one string value. Meaning, I can manipulate array properties, access nested properties, etc.
