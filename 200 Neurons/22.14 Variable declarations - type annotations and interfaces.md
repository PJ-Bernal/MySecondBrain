[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

# TS custom types
TS add some custom types on the top of JS's primitive types:
- Enums: allow to give names to a finite set of numeric values.
- Void: represents absence of a type. Common for functions. 
- Never: assign to values that never occur. 
- Any: use TS inference mechanism to infer the type of the variable, hence the variable can be initialized with any value type. Useful when working with libraries that return several types back. 
# How to declare a variable
As in JS, use `let` and `const`. 
# Type annotations
Specify what data type may be assigned to the variable by placing `: <type>` after the variable name, for example: `let x: string = 'some test';`. 

## Declaring and initializing at the same time

When a variable is initialize at the same time of declaration, is not require to specify the type because the compiler infers the type based on the initialization value. 

However, is convenient to use type annotations most of the time to add clarity, specially when returning functions.
