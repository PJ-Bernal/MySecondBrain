# About types and initialization
In TS, variables are born with types. Meaning, TS will infer the type of a variable when assign. 

## let

When declaring a variable with let and assigning a value, like: `let temperature = 6;` the type is fixed. However, when initializing a variable, I could do some things to allow more flexibility and allow the variable 'to have' more than one type.
## const
Const prevent variables to be re-assigned, but they can be mutable. The first one is immutable and non-reassignable; meanwhile the second one can mutate, I can push more numbers to the array and the humidity variable will always point to the array. 

```js
const humidity = 79;
const humidity = [79];
```
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20250212100530.png|200]]

For TS the value assigned to a variable is a type itself. Compare to the let declaration when the type is number, here the type is 79. 

This happens because TS know const variables in TS are immutable and can't be re-assigned. 
## Literal type
A literal type is a type that represents a single value, like humidity. This request the use of `const`. 
# Casting
After assigning a variable, add `as <type>`. For example: `let humidity2 = 79 as const`, or `const humidity = 79 as 79`. TS allow casting when is predictable and make sense: `let temp = 10 as Date` or `let test = null as 79` won't work. 


If I need more flexibility in a type, cast to any: `let FlexVariable = 79 as any;`. 
## Double casting
I can chain casting only when needed: `let date3 = 'oops' as any as Date`, in this example, is first cast to any, then to Date. This might be done in a test when trying to create an erroneous value. 
# Thinking in terms of sets
To better understand types in TS, think of which set of values are they representing. For example `let test = 10;` its type is number and its set is all kind of numbers. 

However, when casting, the set is only the number 79.

```ts
let temp2 = 19; //! temp2's type is { all numbers }
let humid2 = 79 as const; //! humidity's type is { 79 }
```

## Re-assigning variables in TS
The assign operator = in reality is doing a type equivalence check, meaning, if the left hand side type can hold the type on the right hand side.

```ts
temp2 = 30; // set is all numbers so it works
temp2 = humid2; // also works
humid2 = temp2; // doesn't work  
```

# TS custom types
TS add some custom types on the top of JS's primitive types:
- Enums: allow to give names to a finite set of numeric values.
- Void: represents absence of a type. Common for functions. 
- Never: assign to values that never occur. 
- Any: use TS inference mechanism to infer the type of the variable, hence the variable can be initialized with any value type. Useful when working with libraries that return several types back.
