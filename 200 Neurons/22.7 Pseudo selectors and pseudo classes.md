[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

>The [CSS tricks website](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/) have good example of usage of pseudo elements and classes. 

## What is a pseudo class
Selector that is prefix with a single colon and help to select elements in a specific state. Target some bit of your document that is in a certain state, behaving as if you had added a class into your HTMt, making my code flexible and maintainable. 

There are several pseudo classes, some are: `:first-child`, `:last-child`, `:only-child`, `:invalid`, `:hover`, `:focus`.

>Pseudo selectors doesn't need an element before in order to work, so `article p:first-child` or `article first-child` are valid in this example.

### Use case
Imagine I want to target the first element of a list; so I add a class to it. If for some reason a new element is added, the current element is now the second and its styles go with it, and the first element is no longer styled. I ca use `:first-child` pseudo-class selector that will always target the first child of an element. 

### Dynamic and user action pseudo-classes
Make the page more dynamic and interactive:
- `:focus`: styling an element that is currently targeted by the keyboard, or activated by the mouse. Check [this example](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/f/focus/). 
- `:hover`: will affect anything under the user’s mouse pointer. Useful for buttons, links and even it could trigger drop-down menus. 
- `:active`: changes the appearance of an element when is being clicked or activated. Useful to give the user a feedback.

### Structural pseudo-classes
Powerful way to select elements based on their position within the DOM:
- `:root`: represents the top level of the document; it has no parents. The difference with the html tag is that root has greater specificity. In this class I want to put all of m global CSS. 
- `:first-child` and `:last-child` will match elements that are the first or last sibling.
- `:empty` will match elements that have no children at all, and `:only-child` will match elements that don’t have any siblings.
- `nth-child`: select one or more elements based on the order according to a formula, this is a **extremely** powerful selector.  Check [this website](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/n/nth-child/) to see the formulas. 

## Pseudo-element
They are prefixed with two colons and are used to target elements that don't normally exist in the markup; they act as if you had added a whole new HTML element into the markup, rather than applying a class to existing elements.

They have the same specificity as regular elements. 

### Use case
To target the first line of paragraph using `::first-line`, will select the first line regardless the number of words increases or decreases.

There are several pseudo-elements, but this are the most useful:
- `::maker`:  styling the stylistic marker of a list element. This pseudo-element can use the `content` property.

- `::first-letter` and `::first-line` help to style the first letter and line of an element. 

### Generate content with ::before and ::after
These pseudo-elements can use the `content` property to generate content.

This example shows clearly the pseudo-elements 'add' an element to the markup.

## Combining pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
That is possible without any restriction. For example, make the first line of the first paragraph bold.

```css
article p:first-child::first-line {
  font-size: 120%;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
