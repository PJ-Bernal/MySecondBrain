[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

They offer a cleaner syntax of an anonymous function. It is useful as an inline callback function, like passing it as an argument to many of the PHP built-in functions. 

This is a normal anonymous function being passed as an argument to another function, like a closure.

With arrow functions, this is the syntax: `fn(parameter definition)`, then => and the expression. This expression must be a single expression, meaning I can have one expression, then `;` follow by another expression. The parameter is just the variable I'm going to use within the arrow function.

>A major difference is that within arrow functions, variables are accessible within the father scope without using the `use` keyword in closures.

Detail `$y` is being use like another variable in the expression, but I can't modified permanently its value within the expression.

Detail the array results change, but not the variable.
