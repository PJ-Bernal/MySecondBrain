[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

Divs and spans are generic boxes that contain other boxes, so they give no particular meaning to their content, they act as a hook. Another use case we will face regularly is grouping related elements under one parent element to correctly position them on the page.

Divs are block elements by default, use to group elements and divide the page into different blocks to apply styles. Span is an inline element by default, use to group text content and inline HTML elements for styling; use span when no other semantic HTML element is appropriate. Span is also useful when its wrapped within a block element, like a button (`<button><span></button></span>`)
