Up to this point, I have three test that test different behaviors of a single action method of a controller. However, I can have a single test for testing all or some controller behaviors.

This is the new test, detail the assert section is the same but having the three test in one place.

Is type and is assignable from have return values so one assert can use the return value of a previous assert.

# Testing the mapping 
For testing the mapping, compare the inputted fields against the outcome. Start by creating an assert in which the test can use some fields for the mapping.

Now, detail the assert constructor in setting is not going to use some hard-coded data but the data is just create in the constructor.

Then, I can test a single item in the mapping, don't have to test them all because the mapping logic works the same regardless of the item.  First, get the first employee from the dtos, and assert the fields are equal to the fields passed.
