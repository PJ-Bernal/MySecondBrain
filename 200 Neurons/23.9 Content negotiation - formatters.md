# I/O formatters
Process of selecting the best representation for a given response when there are multiple representations available, meaning, returning a JSON is not always needed. 

The API consumer can request a specific format passing the request through the Accept header of the response for example: `application/json`, `application/xml`, etc. If no format is available or selected, it can return a default JSON.
