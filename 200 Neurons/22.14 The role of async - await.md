# About async await
`async` and `await` make promises more readable. 

When a function returns a promise, add the `await` keyword. This will cause the flow of execution stops on that line until the promise return from the async function is resolved. 

If a function's implementation includes an `await` promise function, the function signature must have the `async` keyword, to let the compiler know the function is doing some async work.

## About the return type
Detail there is not annotation for the function return value, this is because all `async` functions return a `Promise<>`. Now, if the function implementation doesn't have a return statement, the type will be `Promise<void>`, if the function has one, the type will change.

# Using async await
The example uses the same function that creates a promise, now, this other function will call that one.

# Handlig errors
## Try catch
Wrap the function implementation in a try catch block.

## Chaining catch
Async functions returns promises, so when invoking the function, chain catch or then.
