[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

# Watch mode
In this mode, the compiler will recompile the code any time the file and/or directory content has changed.

For that, add the `"watch": true` onto the compiler options tsconfig file, and the `"watchOptions"` as a property if I want to modify how watch works. 

When using a bundler like Vite or Rspack, don't add this option as those bundlers have their own watch mode implementation.
