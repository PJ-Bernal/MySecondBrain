[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

# Watch mode
In this mode, the compiler will recompile the code any time the file is saved. For that, add the `--watch` flag. This flag is not available in the tscongi file. 

When using the `dev` script of Vite, a watch-like flag of TS is being use by Vite called `hmr` hot module reload, this makes every change saved in the project after executing the script will make vite to re run the script, like in watch mode.
