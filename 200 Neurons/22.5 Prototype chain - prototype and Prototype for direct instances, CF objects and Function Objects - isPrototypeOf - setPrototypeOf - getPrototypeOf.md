## Sub-node objects inherit from Node object
Each node object inherits properties and methods from `Node`; some node types can inherit additional interfaces.

![[Pasted image 20240819113901.png]]

In this chain, `Object`, `Node`, etc. Are constructor functions that inherit all of their properties and methods to its descendants constructor functions. Now, when the chain is between function objects, `prototype` (property of function objects like `Node`) becomes the `[[Prototype]]` of other functions objects in the chain. 

>[!important]
>The chain links are reflected in the `[[Prototype]]` of any object only. However, in the case of CF, because they are instance of `Function` but can inherit properties or methods of other CF, they have another way to inherit things, see the explanation below. 

## Inheritance limitations
Inheritance is made from one object only, so I can have only one `[[Prototype]]` per object. This is a bit limiting and here is when I rather use [[22.5 Class inheritance with extend|class inheritanace]] or [[22.5 Mixins|mixins]]. 
## The inheritance chain, `[[Prototype]]` and `prototype`
JavaScript is a prototype-based language, meaning object properties and methods can be shared through generalized objects that have the ability to be cloned and extended. This prototype inheritance has nothing to do with class inheritance. 

When accessing a method or property of an object, JS will first search on the object itself to then traverse to its `[[Prototype]]`. If the method is not there, then it will go one level below the chain of inheritance to check the `[[Prototype]]` of its father object. The end of the chain is `Object.prototype`, check [[22.5 Function and Object as the first link in the inheritance chain| this note]] to see why this is the end of the chain.

This is important because if an object has its own method definition, `walk` in this case, the father's method `walk` will never be called when the rabbit object invokes the walk method. 

```js
function Player(name, marker) {
  this.name = name;
  this.marker = marker;
  this.sayName = function() {
    console.log(this.name)
  };
}

Player.prototype.sayHello = function() {
   console.log("Hello, I'm a player!");
};

const player1 = new Player('steve', 'X');
```
>[!blank-container|float-left]
![[Pasted image 20240814135116.png|450]]


For example, the `valueOf()` method. Is within the object constructor? No, only the sayName method is.

Is the method inside of the player1 object `[[Prototype]]`? No, only the sayHello method is. So, is valueOf() inside of its `[[Prototype]]`? Yes, is inside `Object.getPrototypeOf(Player.prototype)`. 

>[!error] One object can have a single [[Prototype]] from only one object
>An objectâ€™s Object.getPrototypeOf() value can only be one unique prototype object, thus, any object can't inherit from two or more father objects.

Remember that, for example, any array is an indirect instance of the `Array` CF, thus the array has access to any of the properties or methods within `Array.prototoype`. The same applies to `Funciton`, `Object`, etc. 

### `constructor`
Inside the  `[[Prototype]]` of any object is a `constructor` property used to build that object. When an object is a [[22.5 Functions as Object and Constructors -  direct and indirect instances - instanceof#^77259d|direct instance]] the `constructor` will point to the CF definition. When is an [[22.5 Functions as Object and Constructors -  direct and indirect instances - instanceof#^77259d|indirect instance]], it will point to the `constructor` of the object `Object`.

>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20240827111612.png|300]]



Inside any function, regular function CF, etc. Exists a `prototype` property that will include its constructor. 

### `prototype`
>[!blank-container|float-left]
![[Pasted image 20240812141711.png|300]]

Is a **special property/object of all functions but arrow functions** that become the `[[Prototype]]` of children objects when creating direct or indirect instances. Thus, `prototype` tells the CF direct or indirect instances what to do, so instances don't have a `prototype` but a `[[Prototype]]` pointing to its father's `prototype`. 

>[!important]
>- In the case of CF, the `prototype` becomes a blueprint to create objects, therefore, all attributes and methods within `prototype` are **referenced** (not copied) directly by the objects.
>- `prototype` creates `[[Prototype]]`, so `prototype` can be seen as a base property". 
>- Because both `[[Prototype]]` and `prototype` can container a key:value pair of properties, both are objects in the context of an object being something that held a key:value pair. 

>[!warning] Important about `prototype` of CF
>When using CF, the CF will always have a `prototype` regardless I load the `.prototype` property or is "empty"; in reality, the `prototype` of a CF will never be empty because it will have the CF constructor and a object `[[Prototype]]` referencing `Object.prototype`. Therefore, the `[[Prototype]]` of direct objects will ALWAYS be the `prototype` of the CF.

>![[Pasted image 20240814131145.png]]

>This is why direct objects `[[Prototype]]` will always reference the `prototype` of their CF.

### `[[Prototype]]`
>[!blank-container|float-left]
![[Pasted image 20240812140250.png|300]]

All objects in JS have a hidden property called `[[Prototype]]` that holds a reference to its father's Object `prototype`. 

To access an object's `[[Prototype]]` use `Object.getPrototypeOf()`, to set a prototype use `Object.setPrototypeOf(father object, child object)`, to check if a `[[Prototype]]` of an object points to the `prototype` of another use `.isPrototypeOf()`. I have note examples of the use of those methods. 

```js
let y = [];

Array.prototype.isPrototypeOf(y); // true
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Array); // true
```
>[!blank-container|float-left]
![[Pasted image 20240530103710.png|200]]


When a `prototype` of a father object become the `[[Prototype]]` of a child object a chain link is created. This chain continues until it either finds the property or method or reaches the end of the chain (where the prototype is null).

When an attribute or method is not within the object definition, then JS look in their `[[Prototype]]`. Therefore, the object (regardless is a instance or a CF or a regular function), can use all of its `[[Prototype]]` methods.

>[!example]-
>Detail `Object` has access to its own and `[[Prototype]]` methods.
>![[Pasted image 20240807111350.png|center]]
>Object declarations also can use directly the methods found inside `[[Prototype]]`.
>![[Pasted image 20240807111926.png]]

`[[Prototype]]` behaves different when the inherit object is a direct instance, a Constructor Function or a user defined function (or Function Object).

#### Direct object instances
>[!blank-container|float-right]
>![[Pasted image 20240812112022.png|450]]



For direct instances like `firstObj` its `[[Prototype]]` property is referring to `myFunction.prototype`.





```js
function myFunction (userName) {
    this.name = userName;
    this.sayHi = function () {
        console.log(`Hi, my name is: ${this.name}`);
    }
}

let firstObj = new myFunction('Pablo');

//The prototype was alter after the instantiation 
myFunction.prototype.sayBye = function () {
    console.log(`Bye ${this.name}`);
}
    
myFunction.prototype.age = this.age;

console.dir(firstObj);
```

>[!multi-column]
>
>![[Pasted image 20240812111445.png|450]]
>
>-The function `prototype` was alter after the object instantiation, but because the object point to this `prototype`, it has automatic access to sayBye and age. Totally different if those methods where added to the object, in which case, future instances won't have the access to those methods.

#### Built in CF objects
>[!blank-container|float-left]
![[Pasted image 20240812102839.png|400]]

When the inherited object is another CF, like `Node`, its `[[Prototype]]` become the whole father function.

Detail the `[[Prototype]]` is the whole function that `Node` inherits from, and not the `EventTarget.prototype` as with direct instances

>[!blank-container|float-left]
![[Pasted image 20240812102925.png|270]]


This makes possible for the abstract class to have multiple behaviors. So, in the case of `Node` it can be a CF use to create text, document, comment, and whatever node. And also, being capable of handle events.

For now I've only seen indirect instances being apply to abstract classes. 

Only when the instance is an object and a function at the same time, like in this case, there is a `prototype` property. Direct instantiated object don't have `prototype`. 



```js
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Node) === EventTarget); // true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Element) === Node); // true
```

The above is not true, when the father object is `Object`, in which case the `[[Prototype]]` references `Function.prototype`.

```js
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(EventTarget) === Function); // false
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(EventTarget) === Function.prototype)
```

#### User define CF 
In the case of a user defined CF, its `[[Prototype]]` is the `Function.prototype`.

```js
function Hero(name, level) {
  this.name = name;
  this.level = level;
}

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Hero) === Function.prototype); // true
```

![[Pasted image 20240819135251.png|center|300]]
#### Function objects
When the inherited object is any other function and not a CF, its `[[Prototype]]` is the `Function.prototype`.

```js
function test () {}

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(test) === Function.prototype); // true
```

## Understanding the chain for CF
For CF only, they are instances of `Function` but its `prototype` can inherit properties and methods of other CF. This is the case of [[22.5 What is an object - object creation - object constructors and object literals - user defined functions - add properties to object literals#Copy CF properties or methods to another CF.|when a CF have a copy of properties or methods of another CF]]. This `prototype` inheritance follows the same rules as the regular inheritance in which the `prototype` of a father object (CF in this case), become the `[[Prototype]]` of a child object (CF in this case).

Following [[22.5 What is an object - object creation - object constructors and object literals - user defined functions - add properties to object literals#Copy CF properties or methods to another CF.|this example]], detail the `prototype` of the `Hero` CF has one method called `attack ( )`, and because the example is using the `Object.setPrototypeOf( )`, inside `prototype` is a new `[[Prototpe]]` that contains the inherit method of `Hero`.
