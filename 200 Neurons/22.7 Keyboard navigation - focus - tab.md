## Focus
Focus refers to direct keyboard events to a selected element. `div` and `span` elements aren't focusable (when using tab) and don't respond to user interaction or other user events (when hover or click a div or span, nothing happens). `buttons`, `input` or `form` listens automatically to keyboard events (for buttons, hit space or enter trigger a click event, for example).

This code shows how to 'create' or handle events with a `div` or `span`:

```html
<!-- The `tabindex` attribute makes the `<div>` elements focusable. -->
<div class='button-container'>
  <div class='rock button' tabindex='0'>Rock</div>
  <div class='paper button' tabindex='0'>Paper</div>
  <div class='scissors button' tabindex='0'>Scissors</div>
</div>
```

```js
// We also need to manually add in event handling for both mouse and keyboard events.
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.button');
function nameAlerter(e) {
  if (e.type === 'click' || e.key === ' ' || e.key === 'Enter') {
    alert(e.target.textContent);
  }
}
buttons.forEach(button => {
  button.addEventListener('click', nameAlerter)
  button.addEventListener('keydown', nameAlerter)
})
```

>[!important] All user-interactive elements must be focusable
>And have an event handling for keyboards, using the right semantic HTML. For non-focusable elements is require to hard-code the focusable and interactive behavior (like the example above).

## Focus styles
Styles when an element is focused should never be removed completely. Different are the options, but all elements should 'respond' to the user then focused.

To remove completely the focus styles of the user agent use `*:focus { outline: none}`. Then, apply any styles using the `:focus` pseudo-class, like this:

```html
<input type="text" class="border-input" placeholder="Type here...">
```

```css
.border-input {
    padding: 8px;
    border: 2px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 4px;
}
.border-input:focus {
    border-width: 3px;
    border-color: rgba(26, 115, 232, 0.8);
}
```

## Tab order
The `tabindex` attribute determine the order in which elements receive focus when pressing tab. By default, is the same order as elements were hard-coded. When changing the element's order either using `float` or `order` (within a flexbox), the `tabindex` should match that visual order.

>[!blank-contaienr|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20241010113027.png|550]]

In this example the first button is push to the right, but when tabbing, is the first one that is focused because is the first one in the DOM. 

>[!important]
>To solve this I can either move the first button to a third position, or use the `tabindex`.

Only use the `tabindex` attribute if I need to change the order of the elements. It has three possible values:


- 1, 2, etc: jumps ahead of hard-coded DOM elements. The first tab goes to 5, then 0, then the button. 

![[Pasted image 20241010114401.png|center|450]]

- 0: makes the item focusable allowing JS to use the `focus()` method. Useful for div or span. 
- -1: element is focusable but not tabbable. 

```js
function focusAndScrollToElement(elementId) {
  // Get the element
  const element = document.getElementById(elementId);
  
  if (element) {
    // Scroll the element into view
    element.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' });
    
    // Set focus to the element
    element.focus();
  }
}
```

## Hidden content
Hiding also involves hide an element from assistive technologies, not hiding only visually. Use `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` (but consider [[22.7 Outer and inner display types - block - inline#^c82fc3|this visual impact when selecting]] which method to use).
