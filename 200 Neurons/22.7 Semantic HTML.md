[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

HTML elements can be as useful as not a11y friendly, for example using either `<div>` or `<span>` to containerize everything is not a good practice. 

Semantic HTML provides meaning and context (when announced by assistive technologies), `p` has meaning but don't provide context, `button` has both. 

`div` and `span` are semantically neutral. meaning don't have both meaning and context (the assistive technology won't read allow 'div' or 'span'). 

Think of terms of a way to tell disable user if they can or can't interact with the page. For the first example, the assistive will read: 'roc, paper, scissors'; for the second: ''Rock, button". 

```html
<!-- These are buttons... right? -->
<div class='button-container'>
  <div class='rock'>Rock</div>
  <div class='paper'>Paper</div>
  <div class='scissors'>Scissors</div>
</div>

<!-- Okay, these are *definitely* buttons -->
<div class='button-container'>
  <button class='rock'>Rock</button>
  <button class='paper'>Paper</button>
  <button class='scissors'>Scissors</button>
</div>
```
