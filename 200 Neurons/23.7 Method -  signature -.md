# About methods
- Methods are C# functions. 
- Their return value could be optional. 
- Must be declared within a class or struct. 

# Syntax - the method signature
Both the access modifier and return type are required when creating a method. A method can have zero, multiple, or optional parameters, all with their respective type. 

The access modifier tells from where the method can be invoked. 

>If a method has a return type other tan void, it must return that type. 

Return stops the execution of the method, returning it statement. 

```c#
<access modifier> <return type> Method_Name (parameters)
{
  // statements
}

public int AddTwoNumbers(int a, int b)
{
  return a + b;
  // if nothing is here, the compiler willl trigger an exception
}
```

>[!important]
>The method must return something no matter what. In this case, the compiler will throw an error.

```c#
public int AddNumbers(int a, int b)
{
  if(a > b)
  {
    return a + b;
  }
  // No value is returned -> compile error
}
```

## Void vs return method
If a method 'return' void, it can be called as is, with no caller. Otherwise, if the method returns something, it's caller should be a variable.

```c#
DisplayANumber(3);
int result = AddTwoNumbers(3, 5); 
```
