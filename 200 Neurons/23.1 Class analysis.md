## Name of the class
A class is not an island, when an object is instantiated, they almost always interact with other objects. The name should describe what the class does and how it interacts within larger systems. The name is also important for language constrains, in Java for example, the public class name must be the same as the filename. 
## Comments
Java uses `/* */` and `//` for multi-line and single line comments. Coments should be used to describe the class functionality, what the attributes represents as the methods. 
## Attributes
Represents the state of an object. The first attribute uses the keyword `private` that means a method or variable can be accessed only within the declaring object by using the interface methods. `static` means there will be only one copy of the attribute for all the objects instantiated by the class; this is a class attribute, even if 500 objects are instantiated from the Cabbie class, only one copy will be in memory of the companyName attribute.

Now, `myCab` attribute is a reference to another object under the class Cab. This is only a reference, there is no memory allocated by this definition, and that class holds information about the cab. 

[question:: Search information about using other objects classes within the attributes of a class., like myCab]
## Constructors
The class has two constructors (have the same name as the class and no return type). The first one, is not the real default constructor provided by the system, but is called this way becuase it doesn't have any arguments. Remember the default constructor is provided when my code doesn't have any constructor. 

Detail also both attributes are initialized to null, as a good coding practice; another good practice is to test the value of an attribute to see wheter it is null. 

>[!example]-
>If you have an Employee class that includes a spouse attribute (perhaps for insurance purposes), youâ€™d better make provisions for the situation when an employee is not married. By initially setting the attribute to null, you can then check for this status

[question:: Is it really a good code practice to init all attributes within all the constructors?]
[question:: If a un init variable or object referes of another class is not init, Java will trigger an error when try to use the attribute?]

>[!info]- Null use case
>Checking a variable for null can identify whether a value has been properly initialized. For example, you might want to declare an attribute that will later require user input. Thus, you can initialize the attribute to null before the user is given the opportunity to enter the data. By setting the attribute to null (which is a valid condition), you can check whether an attribute has been properly set. 

In the second constructor, the myCab object is instantiated. This line of code ` myCab = new Cab(serialNumber);` illustrates how a new instance of the Cab object is reference by the attribute myCab (my cab is 'pointing' to that new instantied Cab object). In this case both constructors are public, but if a constructor is private, other objects couldn't access them (in this case, if the constructor in the Cab class were private, myCab attribute couldn't reference the Cab object).

## Accessors
There are many cases in which an object needs to access or change another object's attributes; but not directly. A class should be protective with its attributes, thus, they are almost always private. Sometimes, accessor are refered to as getters and setters. 

Thanks to accessor methods, another object can't retrieve object information by its own, it must ask the Cabbie object for the information. 

>In general, the setters are used to ensure a level of data integrity. For example, a setAge method can check if an enter age is less than 0 and refuse to set the value to an attribute.

Also, if an attribute is public and there is a problem with it, I'll have to check all my application code to see which object method is changing that value. However, if only one class can change the attribute value, I'd only check that setter method and that's it. 

>Methods can be static as well. So, more than one object points to the same code.

[question:: use cases of static methods]

## Public interface methods
Both constructors and the accessor methods are declared aas public and are part of the interface. In this case, there is only one method that is part of the public interface of the class. 

>Public interface methods thends to be very abstract, and the implementation tends to be more concrete. 

## Private implementation methods
Private methods are part of the implementation and no the public interface. This methods are called internally by the class, and not by other classes. Like this.
