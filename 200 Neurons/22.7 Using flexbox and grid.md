## Content first vs layout first design
A way to decide between Grid and Flexbox is to consider if your design starts from the content, or from the layout.

A website design can start from either:
1. Content first design: I have clarity about how the content and layout should be, the perfect place for flexbox. 
2. Layout design first: first I visualize the pieces, the I fill the content. With grid I start defining the rows/columns giving my 100% control over the layout. The content in grid can only fill the spaces of explicit or implicit tracks. 

>Grid and flexbox are just tools, for example, if I need a container stretch one additional row, or I need to move it around, this is where grid is useful. But if controlling the layout is not a major priority just use flexbox.

## Combining flexbox and grid
A common use is to layout the containers as a grid, but its children as flexbox. Thus, I can move the containers using grid properties and the inside with flexbox. Detail this [code pen](https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/vYeEOxN).
