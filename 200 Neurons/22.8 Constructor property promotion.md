[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

>Feature added in PHP 8.0 to get ride off the boiler plate code, where I have to define attributes and then, assign them to the arguments pass in the constructor. This promotion combine class properties, constructor and assignment to a shorter syntax; by adding the visibility or access modifier (either private or protective) directly in the constructor. (Using the regular syntax, the access modifier is not required).
>%% %%
>When PHP parses an access modifier in the constructor, it'll interpret it as both the attribute definition (two first lines of code) and constructor argument (`$this->amount = $amount; $this->description = $description;`), and it will assign the value that is pass to the constructor to that attribute.

This is how the new constructor looks like using constructor promotion:  

![[Pasted image 20240312204702.png|center]]

## Promoted properties can't type hint callable
I can type hint any type except callable. 

For example, with the classic way, I can't type hint attributes will callable, but can in the constructor parameter definition.

However, if I promote the attributes in the constructor, I can't type hint the arguments with callable.

## Promoted properties and class properties combine
I don't have to promote all the properties. In this example, only the `$description` is being promoted.

Having an attribute not promoted within the constructor allow to do anything with it, in this case I can do `$amount * 2;`, for example. Promoting properties assign the arguments in the constructor as they are. 

## No duplicates
I can't have a promoted attributes and regular attributes at the same time with the same name.

No class properties and promoted properties with the same name. 
## Type hint arguments
I don't have to type hint arguments, I can promote untyped properties as well.

In this image I hint the description argument, this and the image above is also correct.

## Default values to promote properties
They follow the same rules, that is, only simple expressions, not function calls or complex expressions.

### Except with null
If null is assigned null to a promoted property as a default value, I have to make that property a nullable type with `?`.

## Accessing promoted properties
Using `this` reserved word or without it.
