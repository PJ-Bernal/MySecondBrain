## What are promises
To understand what a promise is imagine I have a 'producing code' that do something and take some time (like a high-end function), and a 'consuming code/function' that expects the result of the 'producing code' (like a callback).

Promises are a special JS object that links the producing and the consuming code. In the analogy of a singer and its fans, the promise will be the subscription list.

Promises handle better async tasks than callbacks.
