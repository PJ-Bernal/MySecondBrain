If using the api controller attribute, the controller will automatically return a 400 bad request if the request don't pass any validation errors. 

To create validation rules use data annotations.

# Adding data annotations
Data annotations are a set of rules (that should be included in the post model class) using several attributes, like require. The attribute affect the property/method below. 

To see all the annotation use `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.`,

For example, in this case, Name is require, and both have to comply with certain max length. 

Now, I have to make sure the model is aware of this annotations adding a model state. 




## Modifying error messages
Use the ErrorMessage property. ![[Pasted image 20250121111708.png|350]]

# ModelState
In the controller class. Model state is a dictionary that contains the state of the model and model binding validation; it represents a collection of name-value pairs that were submitted to out API, one for each property; and a collection of error messages for each value submitted. 

Using model state, whenever a request come in, the rules defined in the model are checked automatically by the controller. If one rule the ModelState.IsValid proeprty is false; also if an invalid valud of a property is passed.

The above is not really necessary thanks to the api controller attribute, because annotations are checked automatically during model binding, affecting directly the model state dictionary. So, the api controller attribute ensures in case of model state is invalid a 400 bad request is return. So the if statement is not needed.

# A better approach
Annotations mix rules with models, this don't help to decouple things. For complex apps is better to use FluentValidation, which provides an interface to built validation rules for objects.
