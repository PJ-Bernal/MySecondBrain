# About the constructor
A constructor is called when an object will be instantiated. If there's **no hard-coded constructor** within the class, C# will provide a default constructor.

```c#
public class Employee
{
  public Employee()
  { }
}
```

Constructor methods don't have a return type, are named exactly as the class, and have an access modifier.

>[!important]
>- Like any other method, constructors could be overloaded, a class could have multiple constructor methods, and the compiler will know which one to call when the parameters' number and type, match the desire constructor. 
>- All fields that are not initialized using the constructor will have a default value, 0 for numeric, '\O' for char, false for boolean and null for references.

Remember is a good practice to have properties wrapping fields, therefore, the setter method validation property will be executed when creating the instance. 


# Modify field members
Use the assignment operator to change a field member: `employee.firstName = "Pablo";`

# Create/instantiate an object
To create an object, specify the type (in this case, custom type, the class), then the variable name, and use the new keyword: `Employee baker = new Employee();`, `var baker = new Employee();`

There's a shorthand to instantiate an object: `Employee baker = new ('Ana', 25);` The class name is not hard-coded at the right-hand side. (this don't work when using `var`). 

Remember objects are [[23.7 Value and reference types#Reference types|reference types]]. 
## Instance variables and methods in objects
When instantiated, an object will have a copy of every field defined within the class, regardless if the constructor initialized or not. This are called instance variables, and its the object responsibility to give each variable a value. 

However, methods and properties are class level fields, so objects don't have a copy of those. 
# This
The `this` keyword is a reference to the current instance. However, it doesn't have many use cases in classes.
