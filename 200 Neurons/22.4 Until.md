[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Is the opposite of while; until loop continues as long as the condition is false. 

>[!important] Avoid use `!`
>Is not the best to negate `!` logical expressions on a loop conditional. If I need to negate something, probably I should use until.

>[!multi-column]

>```ruby
>i = 0
>until i >= 10 do

> i += 1
>end

until gets.chomp == "yes" do
  puts "Do you like Pizza?"
end

## Until is not implemented as a method
Therefore, a `until` loop doesn't have its own scope,  the entire body of the loop is in the same scope as the code that contains the `until` loop.
