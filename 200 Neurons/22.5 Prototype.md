[[12.5 Javascript]]

Inheritance refers to passing down characteristics from a parent to a child to reuse written code and build up new features. JS implements this using objects that inherit properties of other objects called prototypes [^1], which have prototypes of their own until reach the `null` prototype[^2].

## Inheritance in the prototype chain
### Inheriting properties



[question:: attributes/properties and constructors are the only things inherited in JS?]


[^1]: This is why, for example, when using a string, JS knows beforehand some properties like `.toUpperCase()` or `.sort()` just by typing them. 
[^2]: null has no prototype so acts as the final link in the prototype chain.
