[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

To inherit attributes or methods I can add them inside the `prototype` object and then use the `Object.setPrototypeOf()`. 

First I define my CF, in this case Person and Player.

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.sayName = function() {
  console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name}!`);
};

function Player(name, marker) {
  this.name = name;
  this.marker = marker;
}

Player.prototype.getMarker = function() {
  console.log(`My marker is '${this.marker}'`);
};
```

To inherit from one CF to another CF, in this case I have Plater to inherit from Person, use the `Object.setPrototypeOf` method, whose first argument is the children object, and the second is the father object.

```js
Object.getPrototypeOf(Player.prototype); // returns Object.prototype

// Now make `Player` objects inherit from `Person`
Object.setPrototypeOf(Player.prototype, Person.prototype);
Object.getPrototypeOf(Player.prototype); // returns Person.prototype
```

Now, detail how player objects can use the `sayName()` method of `Person`. 

```js
const player1 = new Player('steve', 'X');
const player2 = new Player('also steve', 'O');

player1.sayName(); // Hello, I'm steve!
player2.sayName(); // Hello, I'm also steve!

player1.getMarker(); // My marker is 'X'
player2.getMarker(); // My marker is 'O'

```

>he prototype chain has to be set up using this function before creating any objects. Using setPrototypeOf() after objects have already been created can result in performance issues.

Of course don't use `Player.prototype = Person.prototype;`. 

Also remember [[22.5 What is wrong with constructors - Object.setPrototypeOf vs Object.create - changing an objects prototype directly|this example]].
