[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

1. Indent with two spaces, not tabs.
2. `#` indicates everything on that line is a comment. There aren't multi line comments. 
3. Use of semicolons is optional and not common. Ruby identifies the end of an expression with a line break, and, when there is an operator and the end, it knows the expression continues in the next line

```ruby
x = 2 +
2 
# This is a single expression
```

4. When defining a method or variable, use `snake_case` formating, not kebab-cases or camelCase. 

```ruby
# Assigning a variable
forty_two = 42

# Defining a method
def this_is_a_great_method
  # do stuff
end
```

5. Constants are defined in upper case. `PRICE = 100`
6. Blocks are defined either with `{ }` or `do/end`
7. When working with do/end blocks, prefer { } when the entire code expression **fits on one line**.

```ruby
# Multi-line
  [1, 2, 3].each do |i|
    # do stuff
  end

  # Does the same thing in single line
  [1, 2, 3].each { |i| do_some_stuff }
```

7. For creating classes use PascalCase (camelCase leaves the first letter normal) and no spaces. 

```ruby
class MyFirstClass
end
```
