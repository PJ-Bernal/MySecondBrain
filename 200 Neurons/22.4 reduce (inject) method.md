[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Takes an array or hash and reduces it down to a single object. This method is useful when I want to **reduce the array or hash to a single value**.

```ruby
my_numbers = [5, 6, 7, 8]

my_numbers.reduce { |sum, number| sum + number }
#=> 26
```

In this case, the first block variable is the accumulator, the result of each iteration is stored in the accumulator and then passed to the next iteration. This accumulator is the variable the method return after the last iteration. The second block variable is the array/hash element of the current iteration. 

>[!important]
>By default, the initial value of the accumulator is the first value in the collection. so the iteration will be:
>- Iteration 0: sum = 5 + 6 = 11
>- Iteration 1: sum = 11 + 7 = 18
>- Iteration 2: sum = 18 + 8 = 26


>[!warning] Setting the initial value
>The initial value can be set passing an argument to the method calling.
>```ruby
>my_numbers = [5, 6, 7, 8]
>
>my_numbers.reduce(1000) { |sum, number| sum + number }
>#=> 1026
>```

## Reduce is powerful
[Here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-basic-enumerable-methods#the-reduce-method) is the full explanation about the following code. 
```ruby
votes = ["Bob's Dirty Burger Shack", "St. Mark's Bistro", "Bob's Dirty Burger Shack"]

votes.reduce(Hash.new(0)) do |result, vote|
  result[vote] += 1
  result
end
#=> {"Bob's Dirty Burger Shack"=>2, "St. Mark's Bistro"=>1}
```

## reduce == inject
They are the same thing.
