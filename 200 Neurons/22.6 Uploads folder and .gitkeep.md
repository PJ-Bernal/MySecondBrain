[[12.6 Git and Github|Git and Github]]

When [[22.6 Git add and git reset - How to add files to the stage area|adding directories]] to the project, in some cases the application will need a folder called 'uploads' that will contain something the users can add, for example, with PHP I redirect some photo uploads to this directory. 

Because Git won't track empty directories (but my application needed in order to work), I will need to create a file called `.gitkeep` whose filesize is almost 0 but now, it makes the empty directory traceable by git. Detail here I create the directory, then add the file and when doing git status, git now knows the directory is not being track.

And to add the directory use `git add uploads/.gitkeep`
