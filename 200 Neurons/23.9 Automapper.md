First add automapper.extensions.microsoft.dependencyinjection.mapper package. Automapper is an object to object mapper, where an object of one type is transform into an object of other type, with simple conventions (when mapping type A to B, if B follows certain conventions, there's zero configuration to do).
# Add the service
The register the service. The method allows to add an array of assemblies that will automatically get scanned for profiles that contain mapping configuration. 

In this example the assemblies will be requested from the app domain, for call get assemblies under the current domain.

## Create the profile
Create a new folder called Profiles, add a class called CityProfile that will derived from the automapper profile class. Use the constructor to add a configuration.

## Configuring the mapper
Create a map from the city entity to the city without points of interest dto (because the entity don't contain the number of points of interest).

To do that use create map to add source: city entity; and destination: city without points of interest dto. 

Automapper will map property names on the source object to the same property names on the destination object. By default it ignores null reference exceptions from the source.

## Using automapper in the controller
First, inject an instance of Imapper.

To start the mapping use the map method.. First, indicate the type to map to, in this case `<IEnumerable<CityWithoutPointsOfInterestDto>>` and then, the parameter of the method is source object.

Detail the return type of the method is a city without poi dto.
