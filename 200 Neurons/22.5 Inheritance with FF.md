[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

The [[22.5 Unpack values from an object or array -  the destructing assignment syntax|destructing assignment syntax]] allows to implement inheritance between FF. Based on [[22.5 What are factory functions - advantages of factory functions|this example]] I will extend the `createUser` public interface to the `createPlayer` FF.

```js
function createUser (name) {
  const discordName = "@" + name;

  let reputation = 0;
  const getReputation = () => reputation;
  const giveReputation = () => reputation++;

  return { name, discordName, getReputation, giveReputation };
}

function createPlayer (name, level) {
  const { getReputation, giveReputation } = createUser(name); // *

  const increaseLevel = () => level++;
  return { name, getReputation, giveReputation, increaseLevel };
}
```

In the `*` line, a closure is created because the `createUser()` function is executed, and when the destructing syntax is used, I can extract the exact return object properties, in this case methods, I want to extend (`getReputation` and  `giveReputation` in this case). 

Now, inside the extended FF I can return the extended methods and the own FF methods or properties, in this case `name` and `increaseLevel()`.
