## What is a branch
>[!info|float-right]

A branch is a timeline of commits, especially useful when developing new features or for testing. Branch commitments could be merge or discarded. The principal branch is called 'main' (or master before).

New features or test commits  shouldn't take place in the main branch, there is where the most refined code all users are using. Whenever a new feature or something has to be modified, a new branch should be created to not affect this main branch. 

## Create, delete, identify and move between branches

To delete it with the `git branch -d 'branch name'`. If there are changes unmerged in a branch when is being deleted, git will advise about it. If I want to delete the branch anyways add the `-f` flag.
