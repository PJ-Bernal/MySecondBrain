[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

When using `as`, I tell TS explicitly to treat a value as a specific type regardless of whether it actually is that type, hence, type assertion overrides type checking.

TS allows the developer to do this because in some cases the developer could have more context about the type of a variable, for example, when making a request to an API.
