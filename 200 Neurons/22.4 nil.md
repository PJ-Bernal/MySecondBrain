[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Works as the classing `null`. 

The `.nill?` method checks if something is nil:

```ruby
irb :001 > "Hello, World".nil?
=> false
```

When using as an operand, it represents false. In this case, the code is not being executed.

```ruby
irb :001 > if nil
irb :002 > puts "Hello, World!"
irb :003 > end
=> nil
```

false and nil are not the same, even both evaluate as false when being used as an operand. 

```ruby
irb :001 > false == nil
=> false
```
