[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

To determine whether an expression is true or false I can use == != < > <= >= and the following three.
- == and != checks if the **values** only are equal or not. 
- When comparing numeric string with < or > the comparison is character by character, from left to right looking for the character that is different, once it finds it, makes a decision based on that. If both strings are equal up to the length of the shorter string as in the final example, then the shorter string is considered less than the longer string (this is the last case). **Comparison must be of the same type**

```ruby
irb :004 > "4" > "5"
=> false

irb :005 > "42" < "402"
=> false

irb :006 > "42" > "402"
=> true

irb :007 > "42" < "420"
=> true
```

## `.eql?`
Checks both the **value type and the actual value**.

```ruby
5.eql?(5.0) #=> false; although they are the same value, one is an integer and the other is a float
5.eql?(5)   #=> true
```

## `.equal?`
Checks whether both values **are the exact same object** in memory.

```ruby
a = 5
b = 5
puts a.equal?(b) #=> true
a = 'hi'
b = 'hi'
puts a.equal?(b) #=> false
```

## `<=>` or the spaceship operator
This operator returns one of three numerical values:

- -1 if the value on the left is less than the value on the right;
- 0 if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right; and
- 1 if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.

```ruby
5 <=> 10    #=> -1
10 <=> 10   #=> 0
10 <=> 5    #=> 1
```
