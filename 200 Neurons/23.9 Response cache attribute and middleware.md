# How to implement cache in the API
To enable caching my code needs to:
- State for each resource whether or not it's cacheable, use a response header: `Cache-control: max-age=120`,  this is the most common header. 
- Use the `[ResponseCache]` attribute. 

>[!important]
>The above only sets the headers, but the resources is not cached yet; indicate where it should be cached (private, proxy, server).

MS provides a cache store at API level adding a caching middleware.
