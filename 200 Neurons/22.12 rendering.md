[[12.12 React|React]]

When a component re-renders all of its callbacks (functions) are 'recreated' again, meaning all variables inside of the component are set to its initial values (this don't happen with state bindings). All of the child components also re-render (if they are not memoized).

Because every render generates a new reference of the function handle click, the child see this as a new function, and that's why it renders again, even if the function is not really changing at all. 

```jsx
// Parent Component
function Parent() {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  
  // This function is recreated (new reference) on EVERY render
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('clicked');
  };

  console.log('Parent rendered');  // This logs on every text change

  return (
    <div>
      <input 
        value={text} 
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} 
      />
      <Child onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}

// Child Component
function Child({ onClick }) {
  console.log('Child rendered');  // This also logs on every text change!
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;
}
```
