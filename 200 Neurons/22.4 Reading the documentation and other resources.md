[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

## Class convention

>The title may refers to a class or module; how to differ? Some documentation use the `::` to define a namespace, specially useful to make a difference between same name classes from different modules. For example, `ActiveRecord::Base`, is referring to the class Base of the module ActiveRecord, but there will be other classes called Base. 

## Methods (instance and class methods)
`::` in the method's section refers to class methods. `#` Refers to instance methods. This convention only applies to the documentation, inside the language, `::` is used as a name space; and `#` are comments. 

## Parent and inheritance
In Ruby every class sub-classes from some "parent".  The class you're looking at also has access to methods - both instance and class - documented in the parent class.

In this example, `String` class's parent is `Object`. 

## Home
To browser all Ruby classes. 

## Include modules
Are methods that are available for that class, but the classes have no parent - child relationship. In the case of String, a module is `Comparable`, so I can use the `between?` method. 

## Other options besides the official documentation 
- [Unofficial Ruby documentation site ](https://rubyapi.org/) Improve the appearance of the official documentation.
- [This site](https://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core) includes additional information and examples not present in the official documentation. Be aware the documentation is not up to date; 3.0.2, when ruby is 3.3.0+
- [Ruby-doc.org](https://ruby-doc.org/) also improves appearance but is ad supported and suffer from broken links.
