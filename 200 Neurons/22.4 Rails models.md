[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Within the models directory are the files that represents the tables of the database; each file represents a table in the db. This tables are represented with a class; whose body can contain code, for example, the relationships between tables.

>Even if the model file is totally empty, AR still will need that file to 'identify' the tables, otherwise an error will appear. 
## AR associations
I can define one to many (`has_many :<table name>`) and many to one (`belongs_to :<table name>`) associations.

Even if a table doesn't have an association or perform some actions like the table above, it must have a class.

## Code and associations vs schema
>[!important]
>The schema is not coded within the models classes. The schema goes directly into the controllers file.
