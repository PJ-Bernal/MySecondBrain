# About custom types
There are five kind of types which are enclosed in either value or reference types.

Custom types, then, refer to user defined types, .NET include predefine value and refence types.

The BCL contains a large collection of custom types, mostly classes.

# Types in namespaces
Custom types are organized in namespaces to avoid name collision and organization. Thus, C# have multiple types with the same name as long as they live in different namespaces.

`System` itself is a namespace that includes another namespaces. They also start with `System` follow by a dot and a work that describe what the namespace is about. 

My own customer types will be place in a namespace. 

Because members of different namespaces can have a common name, the code need to let the compiler know where to look for a specific member with the `using` keyword at the top of the file.

Once a namespace is 'imported' with `using` all types of that namespace are available within the code.

## Global usings
Some namespaces are common in many code bases, so they use using statements that are globally set and automatically 'place' in the code base, so I don't need to include those using statements, meaning, I could work with types from those namespaces directly. 

Upon compilation, VS will generate a file that contains the following code, containing the global using statements, this is the `<project name>.GlobalUsings.cs` file content.

Global usings are generated automatically when creating a class, however, they could be removed from the document. 

### Global usings file
Within the file explorer: within the project directory -> obj -> dbg -> net8.0 -> `<project name>.GlobalUsings.cs
