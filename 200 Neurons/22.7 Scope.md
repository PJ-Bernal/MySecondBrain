[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

The scope of a property is determined by a selector, meaning, I can use the custom property within the selector that is defined and its descendants. 

In this example, only the cool paragraph het styled since it's a descendant of the element where the custom property is being defined, 
```HTML
<div class='cool-div'>
  <p class='cool-paragraph'>Check out my cool, red background!</p>
</div>

<p class='boring-paragraph'>I'm not in scope so I'm not cool.</p>
```

```CSS
.cool-div {
  --main-bg: red;
}

.cool-paragraph {
  background-color: var(--main-bg);
}

.boring-paragraph {
  background-color: var(--main-bg);
}
```
