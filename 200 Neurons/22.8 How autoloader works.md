[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

To use the autoloader I need the following function. 
## How to create the `spl_autoload_register()` function
The first parameter is a callback function, which is going to be a custom autoloading function, whose argument is the fully qualified class name, in the example this name is represented by `$class`. 

### `spl_autoload_register()` is not executed when `require` is present
In this example, `var_dump($class);` is not printed; what is getting printed is the `var_dump($paddleTransaction);`. This is because if the require or include statements tell PHP how to load a class/file in the global space, the autoloader function doesn't need to run.

## How autoloader function works
>[!important]
>PHP knows what the qualified name is (in this example `"App\PaymentGate..."`) based on the class that is being instantiated first in the source code. Even though the `$class` variable hasn't been defined anywhere else. 

The error happens because PHP no longer know how to load that class. It knows the name spaces, but not the actual PHP file. Also detail because the require statements are commented, PHP doesn't know how to load the files, so the autoloader function executes, print the `var_dump($class);` and when try to instantiate a Transaction object, it throws an error.

When a class is unused, like in this case, PHP will check if that class exists (checking any require or include statement). If it doesn't exist, before throwing any errors, it looks for any registered autoloader functions and runs them one by one (top to down order) in a queue. 

### Autoloader queue in action
Autoloaders runs in queue when a use class is not found. This happens according to which one was hard coded first.

I can use a third argument `prepend: true`, to prepend the autoloader up the queue instead of appending it to the end. So the first autoloader in the queue now is 2.

## How to make the autoloader function load the class
As mentioned above, `$class` obtains the fully qualified name from the `use` import. 

To import the class I have to build a `require` path file (that looks the same of the comments in the image) and then include it (the fully qualify name is different from a the file path).

![[Pasted image 20240313093037.png]]

I can get the file path from the fully qualified class name doing some parsing. To accomplish this:

1. Use `str.replace ('\\, '/'), $class);` that will replace `\` for `/`.  
2. `. '.php'` to append the php extension.
3. Lower case the first letter of the fully qualified name using `lcfirst()`.

>[!error] DETAIL THIS
>With the above, I should obtain the qualify name; however, a warning remains because this is a path that is within the project system, and not a "internal system project path", something like `C:\xampp\htdocs\Project\Main`.
>
>In this example, the "full path" is `/var/www/public/` but that changes according to the machine. 


![[Pasted image 20240313093534.png]]

To obtain this full path use the magic constant `__DIR__` that will return the current directory of the file I'm coding in.

>[!error] If not using virtual host
>The following code will work. In this case I'm including the full path `C:/xampp...`

```PHP
<?php

//require_once '../Classes/First/first.php';
// require_once '../Classes/Second/second.php';

use Classes\First\first;

spl_autoload_register(function($class){
    var_dump(__DIR__);
    echo '<br />';
    $path = str_replace('\\', '/', __DIR__ ) . '/../' .  str_replace('\\', '/', $class) . '.php';
    require $path;
    var_dump($path);
});

$test = new first();
var_dump($test);
```

Detail in this case, `__DIR__` gives me the full path of the `index.php`., This path includes the `\Main` directory I don't need, because the classes I want to import are within the classes directory. Thus, I have to include the `/../` to go one level up, and then, go into `Classes\First\first`.

>[!error] If I'm using virtual host
>The following code will work. In this case I'm not including the full path, detail the path 
Now, according to the PSR-4, the autoloader must not return a value, warning or exceptions. So the final real result is this one.

If the if is not included, then, if the path goes to a file that doesn't exists, then it will throw a warning. 

```PHP
<?php

//require_once '../Classes/First/first.php';
// require_once '../Classes/Second/second.php';

use Classes\First\first;

spl_autoload_register(function($class){
    var_dump(__DIR__);
    echo '<br />';
    $path = str_replace('\\', '/', __DIR__ ) . '/../' .  str_replace('\\', '/', $class) . '.php';
    
    if(file_exists($path)){
		require $path;
	    var_dump($path);
	    }
    
});

$test = new first();
var_dump($test);
```

Finally, according to the PSR-4 standards, the autoloader must not return something.
