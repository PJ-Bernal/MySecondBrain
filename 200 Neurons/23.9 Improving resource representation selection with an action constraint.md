The current get author implementation is long, so high responsibility for one action. The created action constrain can solve that. The implementation of the action method is currently deciding what to do depending on the accept header, use the action constraint to constraint a request with a certain accept header, to an specific action. So split the get action method.

The action method have four actions that depend on the accept header: full+json, full.hateoas+json, friendly+json, friendly.hateoas+json. So I can spli that in four actoins.

# Second action
