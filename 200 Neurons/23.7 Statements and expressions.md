# What is a statement
Actions that make a program, like `Console.WriteLine(“Hello”);` that are executed from top to bottom, order that is called the flow of execution. Statements always ends on semicolon. 

More than one-line statements must be enclosed in curly braces. 

Whitespace and line breaks are ignored by the compiler. 

# What is a expression
Piece of code that evaluates to a value. All expressions return a value. The return type should be the same as the variable on the left sigh of the declaration statement. 

They are usually what is on the right hand side of an equal sign. 

Expressions can be used everyone a value is needed, even to assign a value to a variable.
