[[13.1 OO Programming|OOP]]

This principle (the first one of the 5 design principles) states that a class, object, module, anything. should only have one responsibility., This doesnâ€™t mean that an object can only do one thing, but it does mean that everything an object does should be part of one responsibility, the implementation should focus in one single thing. Of course I can call and use other classes inside of the class. 

One example is to separate the DOM modification from the application logic one. For example, the following code has two issues.

```js
function isGameOver() {

  // game over logic goes here!

  if (gameOver) {
    const gameOverDiv = document.createElement('div');
    gameOverDiv.classList.add('game-over');
    gameOverDiv.textContent = `${this.winner} won the game!`;
    document.body.appendChild(gameOverDiv);
  }
}
```

1. The function, being part of a larger module shouldn't manipulate the DOM directly. The DOM manipulation should have its own module.

```js
function isGameOver() {

  // game over logic goes here!

  if (gameOver){
    DOMStuff.gameOver(this.winner);
  }
}
```
 
2. The above code still has a problem because the function named isGameOver is doing more than just checking if the game is over. It's also triggering the game over action, so `isGameOver` should not be responsible for calling `DOMStruff.gameOver`. 

A better approach include having a module/function that handles game logic. And another module that handles UI updates. 

>Thus, each function should have a single reason to change. Otherwise, if an object is trying to have multiple responsibilities, changing one aspect might affect another.

```js
// Game logic
function isGameOver() {
  // game over logic goes here!
  // This function should only check the game state
  // and return true or false
  return gameOver; // Assuming gameOver is a variable holding the game state
}

// DOM manipulation
const DOMStuff = {
  gameOver: function(winner) {
    const gameOverDiv = document.createElement('div');
    gameOverDiv.classList.add('game-over');
    gameOverDiv.textContent = `${winner} won the game!`;
    document.body.appendChild(gameOverDiv);
  }
};

// Game loop or main game function
function runGameLoop() {
  // ... other game logic ...
  
  if (isGameOver()) {
    DOMStuff.gameOver(this.winner);
  }
  
  // ... continue game loop ...
}
```

## Another example
In the following example, the principle is broken because the class has two methods though have a relationship, perform totally different actions. One starts the car class, another manage the way a message is output.

>Detail here the constructor is not consider as something the class can do. 

```js
class Car {
  constructor(make, model) {
      this.make = make;
      this.model = model;
  }

  start() {
      if (// Logic to determine whether or not the car should start) { 
          this.errorLog(`The car ${this.make} ${this.model} started.`);
          return true;
      }
      this.errorLog(`The car ${this.make} ${this.model} failed to start.`);
      return false;
  }

  errorLog(message) {
      console.log(message);
  }
}
```

What if I have 10 classes, each one with its own `errorLog()` method, and because of a update I need to change its implementation? Then I'll have to updated those 10 classes. Additionally, the Car class should not be responsible for output information! 

Though it make sense thinking the car class is responsible of output its own information, the questions could be: 
- Can I make this feature responsible of itself? yes, output a message is not dependent on the car class).
- If I need to refactor or update the feature, do I have to change code in several places? If the answer to this question is yes, most likely my code is breaking the single responsibility principle.

This is the refactor of the above code. Detail the output method is store in another class, so the Car class can change or even being removed, without affecting the output class. Now if I need to update the way the messages are output, I don't need to make 10, but 1 change. 

```js
class ErrorLog {
    static log(message) {
        console.log(message);
    }
}

class Car {
    constructor(make, model) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
    }

    start() {
        if (...) { // Logic to determine whether or not the car should start
            ErrorLog.log(`The car ${this.make} ${this.model} started.`);
            return true;
        }
        ErrorLog.log(`The car ${this.make} ${this.model} failed to start.`);
        return false;
    }
}
```
