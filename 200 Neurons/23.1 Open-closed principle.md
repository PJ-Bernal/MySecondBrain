[[13.1 OO Programming|OOP]]

The principle states the code should be open for extension, but closed for modification easily and without changing the original implementation. This is where [[22.5 Class inheritance with extend|class inheritance with extend]] is useful.

This close part of the principle gets violated immediately when I need to add a condition to the original implementation in order to a new feature to work. So if the code outside of the class changes, the class code should remain the same. 

The open part is violated when in order to add a feature, I can't do that outside of the code, so I need to change something inside of the class. Changes or additions outside of the code, should never reflect in changes inside of the class. 

Imagine I have this base code.

```js
class Vehicle {
    constructor(fuelCapacity, fuelEfficiency) {
        this.fuelCapacity = fuelCapacity;
        this.fuelEfficiency = fuelEfficiency;
    }

    getRange() {
        return this.fuelCapacity * this.fuelEfficiency;
    }
}

const standardVehicle = new Vehicle(10, 15);

console.log(standardVehicle.getRange()); // Outputs '150'
```

Now I want to have another vehicle with an electric thing, so the first refactor is this. But I have a problem because now, the Vehicle class `getRange` method needs to check the instance type to know how to calculate the range. So I'm breaking the principle because I alter the implementation of the main class. 

```js
class Vehicle {
    constructor(fuelCapacity, fuelEfficiency) {
        this.fuelCapacity = fuelCapacity;
        this.fuelEfficiency = fuelEfficiency;
    }

    getRange() {
        let range = this.fuelCapacity * this.fuelEfficiency;

        if (this instanceof HybridVehicle) {
            range += this.electricRange;
        }
        return range;
    }
}

class HybridVehicle extends Vehicle {
    constructor(fuelCapacity, fuelEfficiency, electricRange) {
        super(fuelCapacity, fuelEfficiency);
        this.electricRange = electricRange;
    }
}

const standardVehicle = new Vehicle(10, 15);
const hybridVehicle = new HybridVehicle(10, 15, 50);

console.log(standardVehicle.getRange()); // Outputs '150'
console.log(hybridVehicle.getRange()); // Outputs '200'
```

The final version is this, when the code is **overriding** the get method.

```js
class Vehicle {
    constructor(fuelCapacity, fuelEfficiency) {
        this.fuelCapacity = fuelCapacity;
        this.fuelEfficiency = fuelEfficiency;
    }

    getRange() {
        return this.fuelCapacity * this.fuelEfficiency;
    }
}

class HybridVehicle extends Vehicle {
    constructor(fuelCapacity, fuelEfficiency, electricRange) {
        super(fuelCapacity, fuelEfficiency);
        this.electricRange = electricRange;
    }

    getRange() {
        return (this.fuelCapacity * this.fuelEfficiency) + this.electricRange;
    }
}

const standardVehicle = new Vehicle(10, 15);
const hybridVehicle = new HybridVehicle(10, 15, 50);

console.log(standardVehicle.getRange()); // Outputs '150'
console.log(hybridVehicle.getRange()); // Outputs '200'
```

>When the implementation of the father class has a switch of if statement, usually that tells the open-closed principle is being violated. 

Another solution to prevent this principle violation is to break the father class in subclasses.
