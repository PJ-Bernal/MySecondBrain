The format use to report errors is the problem details format, based on the problem details for HTTP APIs RFC, that aims to provide an unified way to report problems, because sometimes status code are not enough to describe an error. 

This is the format.

To report a problem, the header for content is problem+json, hence, clients can know what to expect in the body of the response. `errors` describe the validation errors. 

But, in this examples, is better a 422, passing a detail and instance.
