[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]
This is what a version dependency issue could look like:

![[Pasted image 20240528124536.png]]

To solve this I have to get the right version of the dependencies, delete the Gemfile.lock, write the correct versions in the Gemfile file, and the execute `bundler install`.

When doing this, my versions of Ruby could also prevent some dependencies to run at those specific or older dependencies versions. So I have to downgrade Ruby itself..

## Specifying Ruby's versions
Ruby's versions are being managed by asdf, so, asdf has a file called `.tool-versions` in which I can specify the versions I want to use for Ruby. This file should be within the root folder.

Then execute `asdf install ruby 2.3.4`.

>If I needed to change the Ruby's versions, I have to bundle install again.
### Switching between Ruby's versions
When I have several versions installed, I can switch from versions with `asdf shell ruby <version>`, but first I need to install that specific version.

This means, I can set a "default" version of Ruby in one folder with the shell command, and even though my default 'system ruby' version is for example 3.3.0, the version of that folder will be 2.3.4 because of the shell command every time I open that project. I don't have to manually execute the project every time.

## Dev containers vs tool-version
Another way to achieve the above is using dev containers.
