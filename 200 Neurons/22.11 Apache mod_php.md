[[12.8 PHP|PHP]] - [[12.11 Servers|Servers]]

By default Apache comes with something called `mod_php`, that means the PHP interpreter is embedded within the Apache webserver so it can interpret and execute PHP scripts embedded within HTML files or standalone PHP files.

>When a request for a PHP file is received by the Apache server, mod_php processes the PHP code and generates HTML output, which is then sent back to the client's web browser.

>The PHP info form in the browser, detail the Server API is Apache 2.0 handler, this means Apache is using this mod_php.

>The downside of mod_php is the footprint for each apache process is larger because it requires more resources when the php interpreter is embedded within apache. When the request is for a non-php file (like static files), the process will still contain the php interpreter.
