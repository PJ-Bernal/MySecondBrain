Migrations allow to create a db, alter, create, and delete a table. 

# Create the db
Create an initial snapshot of the db. Open the package manager and install microsoft.entity.framework.tools. 

Open the package manager console and `add-migration <any name>`. A new folder is created with the initial snapshot and the initial migration. After that, ensure the migration is apply executing `update-database`. After that a file CityInfo.db is created. 

One thing is create a migration other is executing it. 

## Seeing the sqlite db
Open extension tool bar, and install sqlite and sql server compact toolbox. Once installed, go to view -> other views -> sqlite and sql server compact toolbox. Add a data connection ![[Pasted image 20250122115751.png]]  .

The tables there must match the entity models, with on additional table for the migrations.
