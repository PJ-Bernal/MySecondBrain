Good candidates for unit test are algorithms, behaviors, rules, validation rules; and not data access of validation between components.

In this example, the test will test the creation of an employee.

# Creating the test
Create the class and a method for testing that adding the fact attribute.

Then, above search test explorer.

## Writing the test implementation
First, create an employee, calling the method to test, and in this case, the internal employee creation is tested. In this example, casting is required, because the test needs to focus in one piece of behavior, not all code branches of an if.

To check for an outcome. To do that I can use assert, which means, check the outcomes of the test, to certain value; in this case the test is testing the outcome of employee salary to 2500. Equal is used to compared floating point numbers.

Then select the test and run it pass.
