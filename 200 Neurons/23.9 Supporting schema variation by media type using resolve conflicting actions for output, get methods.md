# About resolve conflicting actions
The open api specification for getting a book with a 200 response, seeing by swashbuckle, is like this, where each response results in the return of one specific type. 

![[Pasted image 20250227105102.png]]

However, I want my api to be specific on the **types**, not only the format. The schema of the response must vary with the media type specify on the request. Open api 3 allows multiple schemas, like the below, but not swasbuckle. 

![[Pasted image 20250227105205.png]]

This multiple schemes are not supported for swashbuckle.

According to the console, the error says that open api 3 requires unique method/path combinations, which is false, I implement overloading a single action method with multiple schemas, but for open api one action method should have a single schema.

# Resolving this
In the program class, add the resolve conflicting actions to add swagger gen. The parameters of this method are the potentially conflicting api descriptions. 

Swashbuckle expects exactly one api description as a result of resolving a conflict. In this example, I want to return the first one. 

![[Pasted image 20250227110856.png|center|450]]

As soon as I test the api with swagger, the break point shows the issue. The GET action has two api descriptions, one for the get book and another for the concatenated author name. The `api.Descriptions.First()` will select the first api description, the get book. 

![[Pasted image 20250227111026.png|center|600]]

Now, swagger is working, but only the get book action is showing. 

![[Pasted image 20250227111228.png]]

This is not correct, as only one api description is being shown in swagger. The open api specification needs two supported responses types for the 200 ok. This code merges two different api descriptions into one, 

![[Pasted image 20250227111451.png]]

The api is broke again because swashbuckle internally use a dictionary with the status code as key, it doesn't know what to do with 'two get status codes'.

# About IOperation filter
Swashbuckle use api descriptions to create operations. So, instead of manipulating the api descriptions, manipulate the generated operation directly.

Create a new folder name operation filters. The Apply method has two parameters, operation, that is the generated operation that will result in part of the specification; and context that has information to manipulate the operation, like the api description. 

![[Pasted image 20250227111910.png]]

Then add the operation filter in the program class.

![[Pasted image 20250227112303.png]]

First, this filter is only for the get book action. Now, remember that for swashbuckle, each operation (get, post, etc), has an operation ID. This is not automatically generated, so I can assign an operation Id for POST, GET, etc. Based on the HTTP name.

So, add names to my action methods, and this name will be the new operation Id for that got book method. 

![[Pasted image 20250227112208.png|center|400]]

The operation that needs to be configures is the get book, whose operation id name is given by the attribute Name of the HttpGet attribute, in this case, `GetBook`.

So, if the operation is NOT that one, ignore and return. This is what this if is doing. 

![[Pasted image 20250227112353.png]]

Detail the property OperationId holds the id of all swashbuckle operations. Remember they are not generated automatically, so there's only one operation id right not, Get book.

This operation Id has several properties, Responses being one that includes all the `ProduceResponses` of the Get book action, in this case 404 and 200.

![[Pasted image 20250227112602.png|center|600]]

Each response has a key and a value. This value holds the specifics of that specific response, in this case, the specifics of the 200 ok response. That's why the description is 'success', etc. When looking at the content of the 200 response, is a dictionary that include ALL the allow media types of that response (the one specify in the Produces attribute, the XML added in the AddControllers and the default that's json). 

Clearly. the concatenated type is not there. 

![[Pasted image 20250227112721.png|center|450]]

![[Pasted image 20250227112801.png|center|450]]

Then, I need to add that with a media type as key and open media type object as value.

First, check the responses that I need to resolve, this is the 200 Ok.

![[Pasted image 20250227115629.png|center|450]]

Then, on the Content dictionary on that response, add the  missed type as a string and then open api media type needs a schema.

To create the schema, call into the schema generator on the context passing the type I want to generate the new schema for, and the repository that contains the schemas which is the schema respository on context. 

![[Pasted image 20250227115946.png]]

Then, launch the api, open the specification and there's the additional media type for the 200.

![[Pasted image 20250227120031.png|center|400]]


Detail now the get method on swagger is showing ever media type correctly.

![[Pasted image 20250227120153.png]]

Detail when I selected the contact media type it changes.

![[Pasted image 20250227120208.png]]

Also, this media type is present in the schemas at the end of the documentation.

![[Pasted image 20250227120236.png|center|400]]

# Deleting the resolve conflicting actions 
Right now, I have two API descriptions for the 200 operation. If I delete this resolve conflicting, the specification can't be generated because there are two descriptions for a single operation.

![[Pasted image 20250227120553.png]]

So, I can (must?) have one api description per operation. Therefore, I can hide the all the descriptions for the operations but one. This code is excluding the full author name from the Api explorer. 

![[Pasted image 20250227121238.png]]

This allows to indicate that is a clear separation between what the API contract looks like for the consumers, and who its implemented. My api doesn't have to have one-on-one mapping between resources, methods and actions. 

Everything is still working.
