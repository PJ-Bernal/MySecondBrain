# About debugging
![[Pasted image 20250109114810.png]]

Debugging is the process of identifying the cause of an error and correcting it. Debugging is not refactoring (restructure source code to improve its operation without altering its functionality). 

The debugger allows to find code errors while is **running** in debug mode; this check for runtime errors, harder to find than compile errors. Once an error is detected, the app will go to break mode, the app will stop and I will return to the code window. Debugging relies on the use of breakpoints. 

VS come with some commands for debugging: F5 start debugging, F11 step into (go into methods), F10 step over, shift + F11: step out.
