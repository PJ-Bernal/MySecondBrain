## How to create an object
Each syntax has its own advantages and specific uses. 
1. Object literal: `const user = {};`. Use literals to transfer series of structured, related data in some manner, for example, to send a request to a server to be put into a database. Prefer when I need to write one or a just a couple of objects, because if I have to change a property, I will need to update that property in all objects.
2. Constructor Function / regular function: create using a defined function or a constructor. 

>[!important]
>- Because a name is getting associated a value, is what sometimes objects are called associative arrays. Objects map strings to values in the same way that arrays map numbers to values.
>- Any value of an object's property can be store in a variable, even methods, check [[22.5 What is 'this' - this in the global context - this inside functions#This inside a method invocation|this example]]. 
>- The `const user =` is just a binding, meaning everything inside a pair of `{ }` is what is considered an object. 

Properties have [[22.5 Getters and setters - conditional get and set - compatibility for enhance objects - smart getters|two kind of properties]]. 
## Object literals
### Create object literals Add/modify properties and methods
To add or modify properties use the `key: value,` or `key: function(),` to add methods. Properties can be added inside or outside of the object declaration. 

>[!important] For object literals
>Use comma trailing to make easier when add/remove/move properties, because all lines become alike.

>[!important] Adding properties outside of object declaration
>I can use bracket notation to achieve this.
>```js
>const person = {
>  name: {
>    first: "Bob",
>    last: "Smith",
>  },
>  // …
>};
>person["name"]["last"] = "Cratchit";
>```

```js
const person = {
  name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
  age: 32,
  bio: function () {
    console.log(`${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years old.`);
  },
 //Detail the comma here
};

//Property added outside of object declaration
person.isAdmin = true;

// Method added outside of object declaration
person.farewell = function () {
  console.log("Bye everybody!");
};
```


>[!important]
>Though object literals are not direct instances (using the `new` keyword) of a CF. They are `instanceof` `Object`. Therefore, its `[[Prototype]]` is the `Object.prototype`. Meaning its chain is: object literal --> Object -> Null. 

The value of a property can be anything, even another function define outside of the object definition.

```js
function sayHello() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
}

const person1 = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet: sayHello,
};

person1.greet(); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
```

#### Method declaration shorthand
To add a method to an object literal, I can omit the `function` keyword and the `:`. 

```js
const person = {
  bio () {
    console.log(`${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years old.`);
  },
};
```

#### Object properties as objects
In object literals, a property can be an object itself.

>[!multi-column]
>```js
>// I can do this
>const person = {
>  name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
>};
>
>// Or do this
>const person = {
>  name: {
>    first: "Bob",
>    last: "Smith",
>  },
>  // …
>};
>```
>
>![[Pasted image 20240814080652.png|350]]

#### Adding multiword properties
They must be quoted.
```js
const person = {
name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
"favourite meal": "burger",
}
//Property added outside of method declaration
person["has pet"] = false;
```

#### Adding properties with unknown names
Use bracket syntax.

```js
const myDataName = "height";
const myDataValue = "1.75m";
person[myDataName] = myDataValue;
```

#### Modifying properties
With either dot or bracket notation.

```js
const person = {
  name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
  age: 32,
  bio: function () {
    console.log(`${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years old.`);
  },
};
```

Detail the variable `person` is enclosed in brackets [[22.5 'primitive' variables as objects - console.log as key value pairs - boxing|transforming it into a]]

### Access properties of object literals
To access property values use the dot notation or bracket notation. 

```js
alert(person.name);
alert(person.age);

alert(person["age"]);

// If the value is an array then use []
alert(person.name[0]); // Bob
```

#### Accessing multiword properties 
Use the bracket notation. The dot notation doesn't work here.

```js
alert(person["has pet"]); // false
```

#### Accessing object properties of an object
Add an extra dot to the chain or use bracket notation.

```js
person.name.first;
person.name.last;

person["name"]["first"];
person["name"]["last"];
```


### Delete properties of object literals
```js
delete person.name;
delete person["has pet"];
```

### Property name result of expression
When a property name is hold in a variable, the bracket syntax is required.

```js
let key = "has pet";
person[key] = true
//The same as: person["has pet"] = true;

//Another example
function logProperty(propertyName) {
  console.log(person[propertyName]);
}

logProperty("name");
// ["Bob", "Smith"]
```

Careful when adding properties as variables. 

```js
let key = "has pet";
person.key = true; // I add a new property whose key is 'key' and value 'true'
person[key] = false; // I add the property whose key "has pet" is being hold in the variable key, 

alert(person[key]); //true
alert(person.key); // false Not a desire result
```

### Copy properties and methods of an object to another
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20240819143343.png]]


Though this is not common, and is better to use CF, I can copy properties and methods from one object to another.






```js
let animal = {
  eats: true,
  walk() {
    alert("Animal walk");
  }
};

let rabbit = {
  jumps: true,
  __proto__: animal
};
```


## Function objects
Regular functions and constructor functions (preferred method) have different behaviors in terms of how the objects are created, the use of `this`, etc. 
### Using a constructor function
Constructors Functions are use when I have to create multiple objects using a single blueprint. When using a CF, the `new` operator must be use to instantiate an object. When I create the object: 

1. The constructor is called 
2. The object is created.
3. `this` is bind to the new object, so `this` is usable inside the constructor.
4. The object is returned.

>[!important]
>- By convention, all CF start with a capital letter and are name by the type of object they create. 
>- Remember to check what is [[22.5 What is 'this' - this in the global context - this inside functions|this]]. 
>- Remember I can set properties and methods inside a CF `prototype` to increase efficiency and readability., 

```js
function User (userName, userAge){
    // property = name 
    this.name = userName;
    this.age = userAge;
    this.internalMethod = function () {
        console.log(`I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age}`);
    }
}
const myUser = new User('Pablo', 30);
```

Detail the object `myUser` properties acquire its name from the `this.<object variable name>`, so this is the property.
### Using a user defined function
Don't user `new` keyword.
```js
function test1 (userName, userAge){
  return{
    name: userName,
    age: userAge,
    internalMethod: function () {
      console.log(`I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age}`);
      }
  }
}
const myUser = test1('Pablo', 30);
```

Another way is building the object, and then return it.

```js
function createPerson(name) {
  const obj = {};
  obj.name = name;
  obj.introduceSelf = function () {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
  };
  return obj;
}

const salva = createPerson("Salva");
salva.introduceSelf();
// "Hi! I'm Salva."
```

>[!warning]
>An object method that doesn't require any argument don't mean the method is NOT going to use the value of a property of an object. `.introduceSelf()` don't require an argument, but still use a property of the object. 
### User defined functions vs constructor functions

#### Invocation
>[!multi-column]
>
>>[!important] User function
>>Don't use `new` to create the object. `this` as a value refers to either the global object or undefined. `this` inside a method refers to the object itself. 
>>>[!example]-
>>>![[Pasted image 20240809091024.png]]
>
>>[!important] Constructor function
>>Use `new` to create a new instance. `this` as a value or inside a method refers to the object instantiated.
>>%% %%
>>When an object is created, its `[[Prototype]]` contains a the constructor function and the `[[Prototype]] Object`
>>![[Pasted image 20240809102321.png]]

#### Object creation
>[!multi-column]
>
>>[!important] User function
>>The object is not automatically created, therefore, I have to build it inside the function and then return it. 
>>>[!warning]-
>>>The object returned by the function IS NOT an instance of the function, therefore, the `prototype` of the function is not inherited by the object. The return object is NOT part of the prototype chain of the regular function.
>>>![[Pasted image 20240809100347.png]]
>>
>>>[!example]- 
>>>Though I declare the object inside the function and I can even use it inside the function. The object is NOT created or instantiated at all. Detail when I call `myUser` the return value is undefined.
>>>![[Pasted image 20240809091630.png]]
>>> I have to explicitly return the object, or create the object inside the return statement.
>>> ![[Pasted image 20240809091812.png]]
>
>>[!important] Constructor function
>>The constructor automatically returns an instance, so the object is created without the need of being return.
>>

#### Prototype
Remember the `prototype` property is what all object instances of a function inherit where are created. 

>[!multi-column]
>
>>[!important] User function
>>Because the object is not an instance of the function, it doesn't inherit any `Function.prototype` methods. Though the factory function might have a `prototype`, is not really that useful, because the objects created with factory functions are not direct instances .
>>>[!example]
>>>In this example, the object `[[Prototype]]` of user2 doesn't have the `hi` prototype method.
>>>![[Pasted image 20240809101909.png]]
>>>Detail in the image above, the below link in the inheritance chain of this object is `Object` and not a CF, meaning, indirect instances are instances of `Object` and not `Function`, because the constructor inside `[[Prototype]]` is `Object( )` and not a CF.
>
>>[!important] Constructor function
>>Objects are instances of the constructor function, therefore, all of the `prototype` methods and attributes are inherited by the objects. This is because the `[[Prototype]]` of each direct object references the `CF.prototype` object. Therefore, when that `CF.prototype` object changes, all the reference takes that change, remember [[22.5 Object variables are references|objects are references]].
>>

Additionally, instance objects have literal copies of the instance methods in them. This means if you create 100 instances, there will be 100 copies of the method, each stored in memory separately. However, attributes and method `prototypes` are stored once in the function `prototype` property each object can reference using the prototype chain; thus 100 objects reference one single method.

The advantage of `prototype` is that offers some memory efficiency because there's only one copy each attribute or methods shared by all instances (We can define properties and functions common among all objects on the `prototype` to save memory). And, most important, if I update any method or attribute, all instances automatically use the updated version, but if I want to update an instance method for example, I will need to update all of my instantiated objects.

>[!example]
>```js
>function Player(name, marker) {
>  this.name = name;
>  this.marker = marker;
>  this.sayName = function() {
>    console.log(this.name)
>  };
>}
>
>const player1 = new Player('steve', 'X');
>```
>Detail the object player1 has a literal copy of the sayName method, but its pointing using its `[[Prototype]]` to the `Player.prototype` so it also has access to the sayBye method.
>
>![[Pasted image 20240819110241.png|center|250]]

Here I manually update the `internalMethod()` for the `user1` instance, now image I have 100 instances...
```js
// Creating an instance
const user1 = new Test('Alice', 25);
user1.internalMethod(); // Output: I'm Alice and I'm 25

// Updating the instance method for user1
user1.internalMethod = function() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
};

// Now the updated method will be used
user1.internalMethod(); // Output: My name is Alice and I am 25 years old
```

>`prototype` attributes/methods are common to all instances, but attributes and methods coded within the CF being copies, allow to each object have this uniqueness.

>This is how I alter the `prototype` of a CF to make all the methods or attributes common to all direct objects. 

```js
User.prototype.sayHello  = function() {
   console.log("Hello, I'm a player!");
};
```
#### Use cases

>
>>[!important] User function
>>Factory functions are not preferred to create objects. I
>
>>[!important] Constructor function
>>Is much better to use constructor functions as they guarantee prototype chain inheritance, their instances are objects, etc.

>
>>[!important] Constructor function
>>If `new` is not used, the object will still be created, but `this` will refer to the global object. To check if `new` was use, I can use the `new.target` property.

```js
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;

    // Returning a non-object value (string)
    return "This is ignored";
}

const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);
console.log(person1); // Output: Person { name: 'Alice', age: 30 }

function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;

    // Returning an object
    return {
        occupation: 'Engineer',
        country: 'USA'
    };
}

const person2 = new Person('Bob', 25);
console.log(person2); // Output: { occupation: 'Engineer', country: 'USA' }

function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    // No explicit return
}

const person3 = new Person('Charlie', 28);
console.log(person3); // Output: Person { name: 'Charlie', age: 28 }
```

### Copy CF properties or methods to another CF. 
Check [[22.5 Prototype chain - prototype and Prototype for direct instances, CF objects and Function Objects - isPrototypeOf - setPrototypeOf - getPrototypeOf#Understanding the chain for CF|this note]] to remember how the prototype chain works in CF.

Use the `call( )` method to copy over properties from one constructor into another constructor. `call()` method has two parameters, `this`, and then all the properties or methods that will be copied.

```js
function Hero(name, level) {
  this.name = name;
  this.level = level;
}

Hero.prototype.greet = function () {
  return `${this.name} says hello.`;
}

// Initialize Warrior constructor
function Warrior(name, level, weapon) {
  // Chain constructor with call
  Hero.call(this, name, level);

  // Add a new property
  this.weapon = weapon;
}

// Initialize Healer constructor
function Healer(name, level, spell) {
  Hero.call(this, name, level);

  this.spell = spell;
}

Warrior.prototype.attack = function () {
  return `${this.name} attacks with the ${this.weapon}.`;
}

Healer.prototype.heal = function () {
  return `${this.name} casts ${this.spell}.`;
}

const hero1 = new Warrior('Bjorn', 1, 'axe');
const hero2 = new Healer('Kanin', 1, 'cure');
```

Now, the Warrior and Healer CF have a copy of the `name` and `level` properties of `Hero`. 

>[!blank-container|float-left]
![[Pasted image 20240819132944.png|300]]

Detail the `Warrior` CF though it doesn't have hardcoded the name and level properties, the console show they are there. 

>[!important]
>However, detail `call( )` doesn't automatically link properties or methods define the `prototype` ( Warrior don't have access to the `greet ( )` method) of a CF, to achieve this I have to use `Object.setPrototypeOf( )`.

```js
Object.setPrototypeOf(Warrior.prototype, Hero.prototype);
```

Now, direct instances of `Warrior` have access to the `greet ( )` method.

### Adding methods to constructor definition or prototype
Implementing methods in the constructor allows the use of closures by making use of local variables defined within the constructor. Those variables are not accessible outside the constructor. Additionally, each object will have a literal copy of the method. 

In general:
- If your methods do not use local variables defined in your constructor (your example doesn't), then use the prototype approach.
- If I create lots of objects that use the same blueprint, add the methods or properties using `prototype`.

This example is using both approaches, defined methods within the constructor and inside the prototype. This is useful because within the constructor, the variables defined within are available for the methods, thus the bark function ca use barkCount. On the other hand, the wag tail method doesn't require an access to a variable, thus, is defined using the prototype. 

```js
var Dog = function(name) {
    this.name = name;

    var barkCount = 0;

    this.bark = function() {
        barkCount++;
        alert(this.name + " bark");
    };

    this.getBarkCount = function() {
        alert(this.name + " has barked " + barkCount + " times");
    };
};

Dog.prototype.wagTail = function() {
    alert(this.name + " wagging tail");
};
```

## Objects uniqueness
