Any interaction with the keyboard fire any keyboard event. There are three main events:

-  `keydown`, fires at press and fires repeatedly when holding the key.
-  `keypress` fire when pressing a character key, noy the arrow, home, etc. 
- `keyup`, fire on key release.

Keyboard events are fired through a text box, generated for example by a input tag. 

>[!important] When a character key is pressed, the event order is: keydown, keypress, keyup. 
Both keydown and keypress events are fired before any change is made to the text box, whereas the keyup event fires after the changes have been made to the text box.

>[!important] when a non-character key is press, the order is keydown, keyup
>If I hold the key, only the keydown event is fire repeatedly.
>

## Keyboard event properties
The keyboard event has two important properties: key (return the character pressed) and code (return the physical key code). If I press `z`, `event.key` return `z` and `event.code` returns `KeyZ`.
