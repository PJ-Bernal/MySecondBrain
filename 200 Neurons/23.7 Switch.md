# Switch syntax
Same syntax as usual:
>[!blank-container|float-left-small]
>```c#
>switch(expression)
>{
>  case constant expression 1:
>    // Any amount of statements
>    break
>  case relational expression 2:
>    // Any amount of statements
>    break;
>  default:
>   // Other statement
>   break;
>}
>```


Cases can have any kind of expression, between relational (`a > b`) or constant (`a`). 

Constant case expressions are literal constants that must match the switch expression in order to be true. 

>[!important]+ Switch rules
>Switch don't work for floats and double. 
>The default case is optional.


[question:: what if I remove the break? Do continue exists in C#?]

# Using multiple case expressions
Cases can have multiple expressions:

```c#
switch(age)
{
  case < 18:
  case > 65:
    Console.WriteLine("Sorry, you don't apply");
    break;
}
```
