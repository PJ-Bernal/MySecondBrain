Once a variable has been declared I can reference it write it on the irb typing its name, like the last line of code above. 

## Variables are pointers
A variable holds a reference, to an object when it gets assigned; specifically, its a pointer to a physical specific area in memory that contains the object. In this example, the variable has taken on the personality of the String object, but it is not an object.

>[!multi-column]

>>```ruby
>>person = "Tim"
>>person.id        #=> 53777100
>>person.class   #=> String
>>person           #=>"Tim"
>>```
>
>The first line is creating a String object with the value "Tim". A reference to this object is placed in the local variable person.


>[!multi-column]
>
>>```ruby
>> person1 = "Tim"
>>person2 = person1
>>person1[0] = 'J'
>>person1 → "Jim"
>>person2 → "Jim"
>>```
>
>The assignment of person 1 to person 2 **doesn't create any new objects**. It simply copies person1's objects to person . So both variables are referencing the same object.

This is another example: 

```ruby
desired_location = "Barcelona"
johns_location = desired_location
desired_location  #=> "Barcelona"
johns_location    #=> "Barcelona"

johns_location.upcase!  #=> "BARCELONA"
desired_location        #=> "BARCELONA"
johns_location          #=> "BARCELONA"
```

>[!important]
>This concept is important when assigning a variable to another variable.

### Making a copy or a clone of the object
`.dup` creates a new shallow copy of the object with **only** (so if the object contains reference to other objects or modules, they won't be copied) the same attributes as the original object, but it does not duplicate any objects that the original object refers to.

`.clone` duplicate the object including its internal state. 

```ruby
class Klass
  attr_accessor :str
end

module Foo
  def foo; 'foo'; end
end

s1 = Klass.new #=> #<Klass:0x401b3a38>
s1.extend(Foo) #=> #<Klass:0x401b3a38>
s1.foo #=> "foo"

s2 = s1.clone #=> #<Klass:0x401be280>
s2.foo #=> "foo"

s3 = s1.dup #=> #<Klass:0x401c1084>
s3.foo #=> NoMethodError: undefined method `foo' for #<Klass:0x401c1084>
```

### Freezing the object
Use the `.freeze`. Attempt to modify a freeze object will cause a TypeError Exception. 

```ruby
person1 = "Tim"
person2 = person1
person1.freeze       # prevent modifications to the object
person2[0] = "J"
```
