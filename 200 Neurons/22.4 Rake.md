[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Dependency that is so useful as it allow to run tasks code in Ruby, from the terminal, like migrations (rake is itself a CLI so it has specific commands). So, when I execute `migrate` in the terminal, the interpreter will go to the Rakefile to check for a migrate tasks and perfom what I say. 

Rails has some predefine tasks, so I 'can' use the Rakefile of the image and add nothing more (Rails will set the Rakefile with some useful tasks by default, I have to do nothing specific with this file).

## The Rakefile
`Rakefile` is file within the root folder. This is a basic configuration of the rake file, who is in charge of perform some tasks. This file doesn't end with `.rb`.

The following code is to make migrations work "without" rails, but again, this is not a good practice. When using Rails, it will generate a Rakefile to handle migrations I can use as is.

## Rake as a CLI
Rake is  CLI by itself, so it has some unique commands. For example `rake -Ta` list all the tasks in the Rake file.
