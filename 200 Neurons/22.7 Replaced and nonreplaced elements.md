[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]
## Replaced elements
HTML elements whose content is to be replaced by something not directly represented in the document, like the `img` (gets replaced by an image) or `input` (gets replaced by a radio button, checkbox, etc.) elements.

## Nonreplaced elements
Majority of the HTML elements are nonreplaced, this means, the content is presented by the user agent (this is the default properties of a browser) inside of a box generated by the element itself. For example, `p`, `span`, etc.
