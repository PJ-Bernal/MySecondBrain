# About interfaces in TS
Interfaces don't compile to anything in JS. They shape the **objects** (this is important, how to create an interface? Think of the shape the object should have and the methods that object can implement), remember, with no implementation. The idea is to use the interface as a type definition for parameters, objects, etc.
# Creating an interface
Use `interface` keyword followed by the Interface name in upper case. Inside I can define properties (required or optional) and methods adding the method name and its signature. 

in this case, any object that use the interface require an id, a title and, probable, an author.

```ts
interface Book {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  author?: string;
  available: (id: string, amount: number) => void; 
}
```

# Using an interface
For example in this case, because of the array is is a movie type, the title property must be present, if no, error.

Method signatures benefit from interfaces as they make parameters more readable.

In this case, movie is the whole object, therefore, inside of the method implementation I need to use dot notation to access the method properties.

## Optional parameters
Optional interface properties/methods allow the object to implement a method or to have or not a property. Meaning, all types of one property don't have too. 

In the case optional methods, first check if the method is undefined before invoking it. Here the  method is optional.

## Duck typing vs explicit type

When an object properties map to an interface, TS will infer that object type to that interface, even though the object have more properties.

Detail the object don't have a type and TS don't see that as an error, even though it has two more properties. 

If the object is missing a single required property, then duck typing don't work and TS will show an error

When a variable is a specific type, the object can't include extra properties that are not defined within the interface.
