[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

Union and intersection types work differently depending if I'm creating a variable or using it, in a function for example.

For example, for an union type `|`, when creating a variable, I can assign any value that is present in either set, for intersection types, is only what is in both. 

So, to better understand union and intersection, understand they behave differently in terms of which values can they hold, and how can I use them.
