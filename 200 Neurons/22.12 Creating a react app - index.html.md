[[12.12 React|React]]

Using a bundler is required because React relies heavily in JSX, which is not supported by the browser. Therefore, JSX needs to be transpiled into plain JS to be able to work in the browser. Also, bundlers minified all code and provide optimization.

`public` is where all the static assets like images, icons, and information files for the browser goes. 

`src` contains all the source code, where the `main.jsx` serves as the [[22.5 Entry points|entry point]] of the application. 






### Inside of main.jsx
```jsx
import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx'
import './index.css'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
)
```

The `main.jsx` boilerplate contains the following:
1. `StrictMode` and `createRoot` are [[22.5 Named exports - imports|named imports]] from `react` and `react-dom` packages respectively.
2. The `App` components is being imported from `App.js` as a [[22.5 Default exports - imports|defaul import]]. 
3. Import some CSS.
4. Create a `root` object by invoking `createRoot` with an element from the `index.html` whose id is `root`. 
5. The `render` method is invoked attached to the `root` object

## About index.html
The `index.html` is not inside `public` or `src`, because during development, Vite is a server and the file is the entry point to the application. 

[question:: Why do I have to import react and react dom?]
