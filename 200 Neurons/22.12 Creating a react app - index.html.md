[[12.12 React|React]]

## Creating a React app
To configure React and use JSX freely, a bundler is 'required'. There are two ways to create a react app, that are almost the same:
1. Using the LTS version of Node: `npm create vite@latest my-first-react-app -- --template react`, then `cd` into the generate project directory, and `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
2. first initialize the package json with `npm init -y`, then `npm create vite@latest`, then I have to access the folder, then `npm install`, then `npm run dev`, then everything is ok.
3. `npm create vite@latest` and follow the prompts. The `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.

Or using bun having a template:


React has multiple templates with different configurations, and community templates. 

### The folder structure

The basic React app directory structure could look like this. The `public` is where all the static assets like images, icons, and information files for the browser goes. 

`src` contains all the code, where the `main.jsx` serves as the [[22.5 Entry points|entry point]] of the application. 






### Inside of main.jsx
```jsx
import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx'
import './index.css'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
)
```

The `main.jsx` boilerplate contains the following:
1. `StrictMode` and `createRoot` are [[22.5 Named exports - imports|named imports]] from `react` and `react-dom` packages respectively.
2. The `App` components is being imported from `App.js` as a [[22.5 Default exports - imports|defaul import]]. 
3. Import some CSS.
4. Create a `root` object by invoking `createRoot` with an element from the `index.html` whose id is `root`. 
5. The `render` method is invoked attached to the `root` object

## About index.html
The `index.html` is not inside `public` or `src`, because during development, Vite is a server and the file is the entry point to the application. 

[question:: Why do I have to import react and react dom?]
