[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

To create objects from classes of a different name spaces, I have to use `\` using a fully qualified name 

## Example
>[!multi-column]
>
>I want to create an email object within the constructor of Transaction. This Email class is under the notification name space
>
>![[Pasted image 20240313081715.png|250|center]]

Being in the Transaction file. This error is saying PHP is trying to locate the email class within the namespace `PaymentGateway\Paddle`, thus its assuming the name space as `PaymentGateway\Paddle\Notification\Email`. This is because I'm using the qualified name. 

In this case Email class don't exist on the above name space.

I con solve this the same way, using either the fully qualify class name or importing the class with `use`.
### Using the fully qualified name
To solve this, use the fully qualified name.

### Use import statement 
`use` require the qualify name, not the fully qualify name.
