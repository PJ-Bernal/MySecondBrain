# Adding the package
A context represents a session with the db, use to query and save instances of the entities. First add the package `microsoft.entityframeworkcore`.

# Creating a DbContext
Add a new folder name DbContext with a class with the same name as the project's name + DbContext, derived rom DbContext.

Big applications use multiple context, meaning, there's no need for all entities that map to tables in the db to be in the same context. Hence multiple context can work on the same db. 

In this example, there's only two entities, therefore, one context is enough. 

Then add the DbSets type for each entity, which can be used to query and save instances of its type entity. Linked queries with DbSet will be translated into queries to the db.

Then, inject the dependency to be able to use it through the app.

# Connect to a db
Open the nuget package manager and search for microsoft.entityframrworkcore, and select the package of the db to use. In this example, installed the sqlite. 

The connection string is different for ach db provider.

To let DbContext where to find the db, use a connection string. There are two ways of doing this:
## Overriding the OnConfiguration method

The Db context options builder provide the useSqlite method, that tells the DbCOntext is being used to connect to a SQLite db.





## Using a constructor
 DbContext has an overload constructor that accepts DbContextOptions, so I can provide the context when register the service.
