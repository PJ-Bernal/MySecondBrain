# About the object methods
Mocking an object generally requires to set specific return values for methods the object should have. For example, the `CreateEmployee` method may return a employee instance. To do that use Setup on the mock, passing the method to set up.

# Setting up manually the method
The `CreateEmployee()` method require four parameters that can be fix values (a number, string, etc.) or a specific type of value using `It.` then any method. The type of the value must match the method signature.

In this example, whatever string I use as first parameter will match the required `firstName` parameter.

Then state in case of a match what I want the method to return, in this example an internal employee.

After that the test passes.

## Narrowing the return type
To return something based on a specific argument, for example, I only want to return the internal employee when the first argument is Kevin. To do that, change the first parameter from its any to the actual value.

Because the argument when the method is called in `Returns` is 'kevin', the method returns that.

![[Pasted image 20250305075133.png|center|400]]

If is any other string, it returns null. NO internal employee is return. 

![[Pasted image 20250305075154.png|center|400]]

I can even create several Setups so the method can match and return specific things.

![[Pasted image 20250305075355.png|center|400]]

Now, when the variable that use the method is called, I can pass either kevin or sandy.

### Partial matching
I want to match any string that contains an 'a', use `It.is<type>(rule)`, when the rule is a predicate that determine what is the partial matching about.

In this example, the value passed in the string must contain an 'a'.

![[Pasted image 20250305075931.png]]

In this case the argument passed is 'Sandy', but detail the object return is `SomeoneWithAna`, and not sandy, even I have configure the method to return Sandy when the Sandy string is found.

![[Pasted image 20250305080029.png|center|450]]

This means when two potential matches are possible, the last one configured wins.
