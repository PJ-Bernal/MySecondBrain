[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]


## Linked embed
I can use the `img` tag, or use the CSS `background-image: url(./my-image.svg)`. The SVG will scale but the content of the SVG won't be accessible from the webpage.

## Inline embed
Paste the SVG content directly in the HTML file, thus, the properties will be visible to my code and I can alter dynamically the SVG vit CSS or JS. The only drawback is that it makes the code a little unreadable, the website less cacheable and it could delay the HTML loading. 

>This drawbacks will disappear when using React or a build-tool like webpack.
