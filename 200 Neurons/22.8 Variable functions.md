[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

Variable functions allows to call function from variables by appending parenthesis next to the variable. In this case, then PHP detects a parenthesis next to a variable it will look for a function with the same name as whatever the variable evaluates to.

In this case, the variable `$x` evaluates to `sum`, then PHP will look for a function with that name and pass as parameters the arguments within the parenthesis next to the variable. 

>[!important] If the function don't exists
>An error will appear, so its useful to use the `is_calleable()` function to check if the variable can be called as a function.
