npm is a command-line package manager to install packages or dependencies locally. To consume a package I'm require to import them into my file or run the comamnd-line as binaries. 

>[!info] Dependendies and dev dependencies
>Some packages are used only in development and not in production (like test, presets or linter packages), this is call development dependencies. So, within the `package.json` file, I should name my dependencies as either `dependencies` or `devDependencies`.

npm uses the `package.json` file that contains information about the project, such as the name of the dependencies and their version. 

npm can install all of the listed dependencies with an specific version or run scripts.
