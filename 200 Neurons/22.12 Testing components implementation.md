[[12.12 React|React]]

Testing should not focus on component's implementation for two reasons:
1. Any refactor will break the test causing a false negative.
2. May not fail when the code is broken causing a false positive.

## False negatives
People complain about broken test every time the code change, even the component is still functional. A refactor doesn't change a component's behavior, but it's implementation. 

False negative happens when the test fail, but the component and its implementation is correct. When this happens, the test should be written again, leading to a loop of refactor the code and the test's code.

## False positive
This happens when the test didn't test thoroughly the component, thus, something that should fail, didn't. In this case, more test are required, for testing the test.

## Testing with no implementation
RTL makes a bit more natural testing the component's behavior, without testing the implementation.
