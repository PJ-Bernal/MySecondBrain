[[13.3 Clean code|Clean code]]

Code efficiency is not measure by how long takes to execute, but how many steps it takes to complete (less steps == more velocity, generally speaking) taking into account the number of steps the algorithm takes when the data changes. The answer to that question allow me to know if my code is prepare to scale. 

To solve this I need to know about the [[23.3 Asymptotic notation|Asymptotic notation]] and the 

If a function `doSomething()` takes 20 steps, knowing that worth nothing if then my algorithm takes a parameter, `doSomething(someValue)` that modify the steps to X amount.
