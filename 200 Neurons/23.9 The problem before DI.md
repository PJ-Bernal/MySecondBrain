Image a class called AController that will need to do some loggin logic.Inside of a class, not the Acontroller class, is a service called LoggerService. 

All classes that want to use the implementation can create a loggerservice instance to use the log in implementation. 

However, this creates a tight link between acontroller and the loggerservice. Also, doing this in this way, acontroller has the responsibility of instantite the loggerservice. 

Now, image the acontroller class may want to access some data, which implementation nis in the dataccesservice.

This creates a problem, because, when creating an instance of acontroller class, theres also the need of creating instances of the other classes.

A better approach is to use DI and interfaces.
