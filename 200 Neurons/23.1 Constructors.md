Constructors are special methods used to construct object by initializing their attributes; in Java they have the same name as the class and no return value; if they have one, the compiler will not treat the method as a constructor. 

>[!example]- Example of a constructor
>```Java
>public Cabbie (){
>/* code to construct the object*/}
>```

>[!example]- Example of a method (not constructor) with a return value
>In this case, the return value is an integer
>```Java
>public int Cabbie (){
>/* code to construct the object*/}
>```

The compiler will recognize the method's name is identical to the class name, therefore it assumes is a constructor. 
## When is a constructor called? 
When an object is created, first, the constructor is called, `Cabbie myCabbie = new Cabbie ();`; the keyword `new` creates a new instance of the Cabbie class, allocating the required memory. Second, in calling, it passes the arguments in the parameter list. 

What instance the object is `new Cabbie()` by calling the `Cabbie` method, which is the constructor. 
## What's inside a constructor
Perhaps the most important function of a constructor is to initialize the memory allocated WHEN THE NEW KEYWORD IS ENCOUNTERED. In short, code included inside a constructor should set the newly created object to its initial, stable, safe state.

>[!info]- What is stable and safe state?
>If counter is an attribute of an object, it should be `count = 0` in the constructor's code.

[question:: What is a stable and safe state for an object?]

>[!info] Initializing attributes
>Initializing is a common function performed within a constructor. Don't rely on the system defaults.

[question:: al the aattributes init mustbe done by the constructors always? Talking about objects, not the application itself]
## Default constructors
If no explicit constructor is coded, the system will provide (and insert) a default one, thus, at least one constructor always exists. Besides the creation of the object, the only action of the default constructor is to call the constructor of its superclass. 

```Java
public Cabbie (){
	super();} //This is the default constructor calling the superclass constructor.
```

In many cases the superclass will be part of the language framework, like the Object class in Java. If Cabbie doesn't inherit from another class, the Object class will be the parent class. 

Regardless of the situation, is a good custom to always include at least one constructor in a class. If there are attributes in the class, it's always a good practice to initialize them. And initializing variables is always a good practice when writing code. 

[question:: what is a good customer to always include a constructor? Always init the attributes? Variables should always be init?]

>[!warning] A maintenance issue
>If the code depends on the default constructor, but future maintenance adds another constructor, the default constructor is no longer created and this may break the code that was assuming the presence of a default constructor.

[question:: is the above true?]

>[!example] Same method with different signatures
>```Java
>public void getCab ();
>public void getCab (String cabbieName);
>public void getCab (int numberOfPassangers);

>[!warning] 
>Depending on the language, the signature may or may not include the return type. In Java, the return type is not part of the signature, meaning methods with a different return type but same signature would conflict. 
### Using multiple constructors
Objects can be constructed in many ways, especially when the information to initialize an object is unknown.

>```Java
>public class Count {
>    private int count;
>    public Count (){
>        count = 0;}}

>This is called overloading a method (this applies to any method, not only constructors)
>```Java
>public Count (int number){
>    count = number;}

Detail both constructors don't have any return type. All other methods must have one. Detail the attribute `startPosition` is initialized in both constructors, regardless the constructor has a parameter related to it, or not. 

```Java
public class DataBaseReader {
    private String dbName;
    private startPosition;

	public DataBaseReader (String name){
		dbName = name;
		startPosition = 0;} 
	public DataBaseReader (String name, int pos){
		dbName = name;
		startPosition = pos;}
}
```

[question:: all the attributes within a class must be initialized in the constructors, no matter if the constructor won't need that parameter?]
## How the superclass is constructed
To understand how a constructor is inherited, after the `new` keyword is encountered and the object is allocated, the following steps happen:

## The design of constructors
>[!warning]
>When designing a class it is a good practice to initialize all the attributes (in constructors?). In Java, an attribute can't be used until is initialized (to zero or some valid state).
>

Constructors are used to provide a stable, "safe", state. Although, some initialization could be error-prone, what if the variable is used in a division; Initializing it to zero won't be smart, so initializing a variable always with zero is not a good policy. Therefore, when designing a class, the stable (and not logical sometimes) state for all attributes must be identify.  

[question:: is always required to initialize all the attributes in the constructor's code?]
