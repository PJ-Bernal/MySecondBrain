[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

# About ASP.NET Core
Is an OS framework to create dynamic web applications (server-side rendering, services, client-side rendering) with .NET.  

## Server-side rendering

The dynamic content is render on the server and send to the client.   
## Services

Can be consumed by other applications or front-ends. For example, the mobile app needs to display an updated list of products. Rendering a whole HTML donâ€™t make sense because the mobile app only require the data, therefore, using ASP.NET Core I can create an API, most often an REST API to return a JSON to the client.  

Frameworks like React or Angular can consume that API. Also, ASP.NET Core can create microservices (set of services that together compose the back-end functionality). 	
## Client-side rendering

Usually, these apps will be downloaded to the client and run from there, but other options exists. Extra data is available as a JSON.
