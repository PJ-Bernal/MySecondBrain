[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

Entities are not directly return from controller actions, instead, there's a separate set of model classes, DTOs.  So, model classes are different from entity classes. 

The entity model used by the Entity Model Core representing db rows as objects, should be different from the outer-facing model. 

The model classes, the DTO model, represents what's is send to the consumer. 

This distinction is very important.

An author is stored in a db with a dob, but the dob might not what I want to offer to the consumer of the API. It might be better to offer an age.

Another example is concatenation, because sometimes data might come from different places, even different APIs. In this case, using entity classes for the outer facing layer can cause troubles, because the outer face layer (using the entity class) won't have all the required fields. 

The image shows what could happen if the outer face layer use the same entity model when two APIs are interacting.

That's why the outer face and the model classes are different.

Keeping the outer facing and the entity models separate leads to a more robust, reliable and evolvable code. 

>If a table must change, the entity class will also change; if the same entity class is being use by the client, the API will break. But if not, the outer face layer and the API shouldn't have any problem.
