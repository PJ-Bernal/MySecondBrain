[[12.8 PHP|PHP]] - [[12.11 Servers|Server]]

PHP-FPM stands for PHP fast cgi process manager, which is a better implementation of fast cgi. Think this as a gateway that sits in between the web server and the PHP code. So, when a php file is requested, nginx will communication with php-fpm and process only php and not static files.
