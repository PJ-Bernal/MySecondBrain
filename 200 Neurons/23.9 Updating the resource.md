# Full update
Use the HTTP put method. Create a new model, even though is almost the same.

![[Pasted image 20250121112123.png|center|450]]


Add an action method in the controller.

![[Pasted image 20250121112315.png|center|450]]

Put actions can either return the updated resource as body of a 200 ok response, or nothing with a 204 content result (successful request, but nothing to return). In this case, the content of the request will be deserialized into a points of interest for update dto. (The from body attribute is inferred thanks to the api controller attribute).

First, check if the city can be found, and the point of interest.


![[Pasted image 20250121113115.png|center|450]]


Now, according to the HTTP standard, PUT method should fully update a resource, meaning, the consumer of the API must provide values for all fields of the resource,  To adhere to this, update all field. So copy the name and description.

![[Pasted image 20250121113416.png|center|450]]

## If a field is not give
If a field is not given, it should return to its default value. In this case is null and this is because this code is following a full update. In this text, the body has only a name, the request is a 204 no content, and when requesting the resource, look.

![[Pasted image 20250121113826.png|center|450]]

This is correct for the http put standard, but is not ok for the API when I want to update only a single thing. 

## Testing in postman
With the content type as json. This post request return a 204 no content.  

![[Pasted image 20250121113506.png]]

# Partial update
Use the HTTP patch method, using the JsonPatch or RFC 6902 (tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902), that will define a JSON document structure for expressing a sequence of operations that has to be applied to Json document (the json when requesting a resource).

>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20250121114503.png|450]]

Behind the scenes, the consumer of the API will create a JSON patch document as the body of the patch request, that is a list of operations (like add, replace, etc.) with the respective fields and values to be applied on the resource for partial updates. 

The API should accept that patch document and apply those operations to the resource.

The image shows a request body.

## Add support fo JsonPatchDocument
To achieve this another package need to be used. Right click on project -> manage nuget packages, search for microsoft.aspnetcore.jsonpatc, install. Then search for microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.newtonsoftjson, install, this contain the I/O formatters for Json patch.

Then, add the service, append it into the add controllers service. This will replaces the default JSON I/O formatter with json.net

## Partial update a resource with patch
Inside of the controller class. Because the request body is not compatible with a full update, the code needs to indicate the request body (patchDocument) need to be the type JsonPatchDocument.

![[Pasted image 20250121115328.png|center|450]]

 Now, because I'm creating models for creating and update, I know the type of request to update is point for interest for update dto because this model class only has a Name and Description, but the point of interest dot has an id, and I don't want the user to patch that.

First do a validation for the city and point of interest.

![[Pasted image 20250121120034.png|center|450]]


Then, apply the patch document that will apply on point of interest for update dto. So I need to transform the point of interest from the store, to pont of interest for update dto, by copying the fields.

![[Pasted image 20250121120156.png|center|450]]

Then apply the patch document using the apply to method. ![[Pasted image 20250121120250.png|350]]

Now, what if the patch document change a property that doesn't even exists? or any other problem occurs? for that pass the model state, so any errors of that type will make the model state invalid.

Now, detail the model state check needds to be done manually here because. Finally, add the update and the return.

![[Pasted image 20250121120628.png|center|450]]

## Data annotation no longer works
With the code as is, the data annotation checks are not working because the model state checks the data in the inputted model as parameters in the method. In this case, the inputted model is a JsonPatchDocument, so, as long as that document is valid, model state will be valid. 

An additional model check, in this case for points of interest for update dto, is still valid after applying the patch document. Do that with a try validate model, where any errors will end on the model state. 

![[Pasted image 20250121121332.png|center|450]]


## Testing
Detail the patch request contains a Json patch document, and anything else. in this case, the name field will be replaced with updated - central park. 

![[Pasted image 20250121120700.png]]

This request for example replace the name and the description.

![[Pasted image 20250121120832.png]]


When passing an invalid request a 400 must be received.
