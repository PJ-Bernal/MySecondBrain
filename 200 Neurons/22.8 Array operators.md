## Array operators
![[Pasted image 20240305152531.png|center|450]]

### Union
Union takes the the two arrays and append keys that are unique. If the keys are the same, the result will use the keys of the first array.

Here the only different index is the last one, so the result array is the first two elements of the first array and the last element of the second array. 
```PHP
$a = array("a" => "apple", "b" => "banana");
$b = array("a" => "pear", "b" => "strawberry", "c" => "cherry");
$c = $a + $b; // Union of $a and $b
print_r($c);// Array ( [a]=> apple [b]=> banana [c]=> cherry )
```
### Comparison and strict comparison
Comparison return true if both arrays have the same key/value pairs. If only one pair is different, then it return false. String comparison will take into account the data types and even the order of the key/pair values, if only one pair is in different order, then it return false.
