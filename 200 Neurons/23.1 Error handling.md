Here are some ways to handle errors. 
1. Ignoring the problem: self explanatory...
2. Checking for problems and aborting the application displaying a message indicating the error. 
3. Checking for problems and attempting to recover. The application will try to fix the problem itself. For example if a zero makes its way to a divide statement, creating an if will recover the application, but the answer probably will be incorrect `if (a== 0){ a = 1; c = b/a} `

These three are poor error handling, thus, throwing an exception is required.
## Throwing an exception
Most OO languages provide a feature called exceptions, that are a way to detected unexpected problems and handled them. In Java, exceptions are handled by the words `catch` and `throw`. The key concept is that a specific block of code is written to handle a specific exception. This solves the problem of trying to figure out where the problem started.

If an exception is thrown within the try block, the catch block will handle it. This happens when an exceptions happens:

If the exception was generated (thrown) outside a try block, the program would crash. However, because the exception was thrown within a `try` block, the `catch` block is checked to see whether the specific exception was planner for (remember Java becomes with several exceptions clauses, thus, it'll knows what kind of exceptions was thrown). The catch block recognize the exception is an arithmetic one, thus, the code within it is executed.

After the catch block executes, the try/catch block is exited and the message `the exception is handled` appears on the Java console.

[question:: how the catch block recognized the exception. If I try 3 exceptions within the try block, how the catch block recognize the first was only trigger, for example]

>[!info] Exception granularity
>I can either catch all the exceptions or check for specific exceptions. If I don't catch exceptions, Java runtime will.

[question:: search more information about throwing exceptions]
