[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

## Public instance methods
They can be applied **directly** to any instance of the class. Because everything is an object, an instance method can be applied directly like this: 

```ruby
irb :001 > "world wide web".split
 => ["world", "wide", "web"]
```

## Class methods
Class methods are **called** directly from the classes, like this:

```ruby
irb :001 > b = String.new("blue")
 => "blue"
irb :002 > String.try_convert("red")
 => "red"
```
