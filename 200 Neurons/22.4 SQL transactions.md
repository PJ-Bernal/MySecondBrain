[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

A transaction in SQL is a sequence of one or more operations, such as insertions, updates, or deletions, performed on a database as a single unit of work. It ensures data consistency and integrity by following the ACID properties, which stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. Transactions is pure SQL but AR done it. 

This migration adds a table called products with a string column called name and a text column called description. A primary key column called id will also be added implicitly, as it's the default primary key for all Active Record models. The timestamps macro adds two columns, created_at and updated_at. These special columns are automatically managed by Active Record if they exist.

This means, if the database gets corrupted meanwhile some operation, for any reason, it can go back when the transaction begin. If everything went right, the changes will be committed. Detail the transaction is set prior to start with the first migration. `1. CreateGhost: migrated`.

>Now, when AR migrates or do any action (create, delete, etc.) it will perform this transactions automatically under the hood. 

If something happen during the migration or making a new register, the migration will fallback and the transaction will be rolled back.
