## let
>[!done|float-left-medium]
>```js
>console.log(hoist); //Uncaught ReferenceError: hoist is not defined
>let hoist = 'dog';

Variables declared with `let` are<mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;"> block-scoped</mark> (`{ }`), not even function scope. They have a special type of [[22.5 Variable hoisting - declaration vs initialization - hoisting functions - hoisting classes - nested functions#let and const hoist|hoisting]]. 

Being declared but not accessible is known as [[22.5 Temporal dead zone|temporal dead zone]].

The variable x have block scope, thus the console have an error. The example use const, but with let is the same.

```js
if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
  const x = 1;
} else {
  const x = 2;
}
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined

```

This ensures when declaring with `let` always initialize the declared variable. No init could trigger an undefined behavior that could be misinterpreted when debugging. 

```js
// Example of what is NOT great
let hoist;
console.log(hoist); // Output: undefined
hoist = 'Hoisted'
```

Now, the ES2023 dictates:

>If a LexicalBinding in a let declaration does not have an Initializer the variable is assigned the value undefined when the LexicalBinding is evaluated.

>[!multi-column]
>
>>```js
>>let a;
>>console.log(a); // Output undefined
>>```
>
>>```js
>>console.log(a); // Output: Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
>>let a;
>>```

Meaning, that if a let variable is declared without hoisting, an `undefined` value will be assigned by default.
