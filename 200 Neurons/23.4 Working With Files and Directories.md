[[13.4 Linux]]

## Creating directories
`mkdir dir_name`. In the next example, the directory is created within the cwd (is using a relative, not absolute path).

### Creating subdirectories
The `-p` option allow to create a directory with nested subdirectories.

#### Reviewing all subdirectories within a directory

^e5e469

The  `-R` option lists all nested subdirectories within a directory.

### Name for directories
1. Don't use spaces. They are use to separate arguments on the command line. 
2. Don't begin with -
3. Only use letters, numbers, . - and _, don't use special characters. 




## Creating a text file
### nano
The `nano` command opens the 'Unix text editor' that only works with plain text. Nano's argument is the plain text file name. Executing the command will open right away the editor. Detail I'm still within the shell and once nano is close it won't left anything in the shell. To access any of the option use ctrl + letter (^ is ctrl).

### touch
Another way to create one or multiple files without any content or data on the cwd. Is a useful way to create empty files if a program of script requires that. 

![[Pasted image 20231122190130 1.png|center|350]]Detail how the draft (that has some words) weight something, but the test generated with touch is 0 bytes. 

### Names for files
When creating a file, the second part, after the '.' is the extension which I have to type, Linux won't 'analyze' the document content and append it for me. In Linux, files merely contain bytes, is up to me and my programs to interpret those bytes according to its extension. 


## Moving files and directories - rename
The `mv` (stands for move), move or rename files and directories. The first argument tells mv what to move (one or more), the second where to; if the directory don't change, `mv` will rename the file. 

![[Pasted image 20231122191720 1.png|center|450]]

After `mv`, the relative or absolute path, or no path (like in this case) might be provided.

This is another example in which the cwd is writing, but I'm accessing to the thesis subfolder to move quotes to the cwd writing.

>To change sucrose and maltose files to raw:  `mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ../raw` Having in mind the two files listed, fall up one folder, enter to raw and make the copy.

## Copying files and directories
The `cp` command first argument(s) are the file(s) or directories to copy, the second one is to where; also the second argument allow to change the file name. 

![[Pasted image 20231122194346 1.png|center|500]]

Detail I'm checking the existence of quotes within the cwd and quotations within thesis, if something wrong happens, ls would show an error. 

To copy directories the `-r` options is required. 
![[Pasted image 20231122194933 1.png|center|450]]

## Removing files and directories
`rm file_name.txt` will remove the file. Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin to recover files, when a file is deleted, is unlinked from the file system so their storage space on disk can be recycled. 

Remember to always use the `-i` option to request a confirmation when removing something. 

Like copying directories, to delete a folder the `-r` option is required. `rm -r -i thesis`

## Wildcards
- * : take under the command scope zero or more characters, meaning, * .txt will represent every file whose file extension is txt; or p*.txt all the files that also begin with 'p'. 
- ?: take under the command scope exactly that file name. perro.txt and aperro.txt, then ?perro.txt scope only one file. This wildcare can be combined, ???rro.txt, will scope both files. 

>[!example]- Which combination will show both files? ethane.pdb methane.pdb
>`ls *t??ne.pdb` as * stands for any amount of letters that are followed by a t, then any two letters and 'ne'.

>[!example]- Another example
>![[Pasted image 20231126222519 1.png]]
>![[Pasted image 20231126222536 1.png]]
>$ p *calibration.txt backup/calibration
$ cp 2015-11-* send_to_bob/all_november_files/
$ cp *-23-dataset* send_to_bob/all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd/

Is the shell (not other programs) that expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames *before* running the command regardless of whether or not found a result; and then it passes the result as an argument to the command.
