# About nullable types 
Null is a value type. Useful when a variable could have a null value, but I'm not sure, like when retrieving something from a database. Also, makes the syntax shorter to check if something is null (don't have to write always ifs). 

Use the `?` after the variable type. This could be use with class properties, this properties won't require a value when the instances is created, for example, could be null in a database. 

Because is a type, it also has helpers, methods.

```c#
int? a = 10;
int? b = null;
if (b.HasValue)
{
  Console.WriteLine("It has a value");
}
```

# Using a nullable value in expressions
If an expression contains a nullable value, the nullable member must use the `.Value` field property, thus, the compiler will know it has to 'extract' the value of the variable, if its not null.

Is also required to check if the variable is either null or contains a value. To do that, use `.HasValue` or use the null coalescing operator.

# Null coalescing operator
If the value is null, then use the right hand side expression.

```c#
int test = thisCouldBeNull ?? 5;
```
