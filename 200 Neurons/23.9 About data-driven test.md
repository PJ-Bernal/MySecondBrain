# About data driven test
Some test only differ in the data they test, for example, these two test only differ in the Guid they're checking.

This can be solve creating a test that wrap those two test.

However, sometimes the test may need to test additional data, not only two courses, but five, ten, etc. So, I will need to either create a new test or re-implement the above one.  
# Fact vs theory
Fact are test which are always true and its conditions are invariant. 

Theory is a test for a set of data passing in the test method signature.

## Theory test boiler plate
Use the Theory attribute and now the test can use a parameter to use a collection of data for testing.

To provide data, there are three attributes supported by X unit:
- Inline attribute
- Member data attribute
- Class attribute
