# Adding the package
>[!blank-container|float-left]
![[Pasted image 20250203085355.png]]

Install `asp.versionoing.mvc.apiexplorer`, and register `addapiversioningi`, then chain `AddMvc()` and `AddApiExplorer`  (register services for API exploration and documentation) to the  in the container.

The `substituteApiVerionInUrl = true;` makes the documentation a bit clear. Instead of `GET /api/{version}/files/{field}` will be `api/v0,1/files/{field}`

# Creating the api version description provider
At this moment, there are two versions of the API but one version of the documentation, hence.

The `addApiVersioning` library has a service provider called `IApiVersionDescriptionProvider` whose service instance give information about all the API versions configured in the app. This provider is required to be able to implement a manual resolute service instance to configure the versioning, because the container is not fully built (detail `builder.Build()` is after) yet (and constructor injection can't be used via DI).

Therefore, after the service has been registered, the Apiversioning service, create this service provider and then resolve the service manually.

In the image the service is manually resolute before the service is registered, so, move it after the `addApiVersiong` services.

# Updating the AddSwaggerGen
By default, `AddSwaggerGen` creates a single OpenAPI specification, a single swagger document, that doesnâ€™t work when working with multiple versions. 

To generate multiple specifications, the `IApiVersionDescriptionProvider` contains a collection of `ApiVersionDescription` objects each representing a version of the API. So, loop through that.

`Options.swagger`: register a swagger document for a specific API version with name and info.

# Updating swagger UI
In the `UseSwaggerUi` middleware, configure swagger UI to display all the versions. To get the version use the `DescribeApiVersions()` on the web app builder, this is an extension method that come from the apiexplorer package.
