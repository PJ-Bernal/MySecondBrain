[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

PHP is a weakly (dynamically) type scripting language, so define a data type when declaring a variable is not required and the data type can change after the assignation (type checking happens at run time). This is bug prone but PHP in latest versions supports strict types.
## Find the type of a variable
Two ways of knowing a variable data type:

1. `gettype()` function will return the type of a variable. `gettype($var2);// boolean`.
2. `var_dump()` function that will print the data type and the value. `var_dump($var);// bool(true)`. This function don’t require an echo. 

[question:: does this work with variable variables?]
## How PHP know the data type of a variable?
It knows because PHP will determine the data type during runtime trying to make sense about what data type is. For example if an integer is enclosed within single quotes, is a string, not an integer. 
## Type hinting
When manipulating variables within function or class properties, PHP will determine the data type automatically depending on the context. 

>[!example]
>Detail PHP automatically coerce the second operator to int to make the addition work, but the type of the second operator remains as a string. 
>```PHP
>function sum($x, $y){
>    var_dump($x, $y);
>    return $x + $y; 
>}
>echo sum(2, 3); //int(2) int (3) 5
>$add = sum (2,3);
>var_dump($add);// int(5)
>echo sum(2, '3');//int(2) string(1) “3” 5 Coerced to int, but still a string
## Type coercion or type juggling
Coercion made intentionally, telling PHP the data type within the function parameter list. 

>[!example]
>In this example, within the function parameters the variables are being type coerced.
>```PHP
>function sum(int $x, int $y){ //here is the type coercion
>    return $x + $y; 
>}
>echo sum(2, 3); //int(2) int (3) 
>$add = sum (2,3);
>var_dump($add);// int(5)
>echo sum(2, '3');//int(2) int(3)
>echo sum(2.5, 3);// 5

>If PHP can’t coerce to a data type it will throw a fatal error; for example when coercing an int or a string into an array (`int $x` to `array $x`).

### Type coercion occurs only on the specified line 
After that line, the variable can be of other data type. 

>[!example]
>In this case, the last ‘runtime’ code line changes the x variable to float, therefore, x has a fixed value and the whole function is coerced to float. 
>```PHP
>function sum(int $x, int $y){ //Up to this point both variables are type coerced as int
>    $x = 3.5; //Here change from int to float, detail the var dump
>    Var_dump($x);
>    return $x + $y; 
>}
>echo sum(0, 1); //float(3.5) 4.5 detail the sum result is a float even it was type coerced to int 
## Strict type
To enable strict type use `declare(strict_types=1);`. Strict mode will throw an error when a variable is coerced even if the coercion is possible. 

There is one exception and is when floats are coerced to integers.

>[!example]
>```PHP
>declare(strict_types=1);
>function sum(float $x, float $y){
>    return $x + $y; 
>}
>echo sum(2, 3); //5
>$add = sum(2, 3);
>var_dump($add);// float(5)

>Using strict types is recommended as I have more control about the data types being used in the code. Specially with [[22.8 PHP functions#Union types|union types]], because coercion can be tricky and result in unexpected value. 
## Type casting
Happens when a variable gets coerced when being assigned, writing within parenthesis the desire data type. 

```PHP
$var2 = (float)4;
$var = (int)5.5;
var_dump($var2); //float (4)
var_dump($var);// int (5)
```
