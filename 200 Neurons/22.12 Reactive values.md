[[12.12 React|React]]

You can’t “choose” your dependencies. Your dependencies must include every reactive value you read in the Effect. The linter enforces this. 

Props, state and all variables **declared inside** (and its value is not fix) the component's implementation are reactive because they are calculated during rendering. In this example, `serverUrl` is not a dependency, because is not changing and is outside of the component's implementation.

```jsx
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

Here is part as of the implementation as a state variable, therefore, it must appear within the dependency array.

```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // Props change over time
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // State may change over time

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Your Effect reads props and state
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // So you tell React that this Effect "depends on" on props and state
  // ...
}
```

Here is a new variable that is declared and whose value is calculated during rendering, within the implementation:

```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId, selectedServerUrl }) { // roomId is reactive
  const settings = useContext(SettingsContext); // settings is reactive
 const serverUrl = selectedServerUrl ?? settings.defaultServerUrl; // serverUrl is reactive

useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Your Effect reads roomId and serverUrl
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // So it needs to re-synchronize when either of them changes!
  // ...
}
```

Variables that are not calculated during rendering can be include within the implementation:

```jsx
function ChatRoom() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // serverUrl is not reactive
    const roomId = 'general'; // roomId is not reactive
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
}
```

The linter will check if every reactive value is declared as a dependency.

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // roomId is reactive
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // serverUrl is reactive

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, []); // <-- Something's wrong here!
```
