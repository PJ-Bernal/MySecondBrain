Notation that gives a consistent way to measure the efficiency of an algorithm. It measures the run time of an algorithm as the input grows, this allows to compare two algorithms to chose the best one. 

This notation is not a piece of code embedded into the algorithm, but an analysis based on different notations.

## O(1) - Constant complexity
The algorithm will always execute in the same amount of time (steps) regardless of the input size is or can gets. In this example, regardless the dimension of the array, it takes the same amount of time (steps). 

```js
function getFirstElement(arr) {
    return arr[0];
}

const smallArray = [1, 2, 3];
const largeArray = new Array(1000000).fill(0);

console.log(getFirstElement(smallArray));  // Output: 1
console.log(getFirstElement(largeArray));  // Output: 0
```

>The O(1) complexity doesn't imply the algorithm is fast (in terms of how much time takes to finish), it means its time (steps) don't grow if the input grows or shrinks. An O(1) operation that takes 1 second will always take 1 second, whether it's operating on 10 items or 10 million items.

>    // ... imagine 1000 more properties here

## O(log N) - Logarithmic complexity
If the input size increases, the time taken by the algorithm scales much slower than the input size.
