There's no need to do mapping when deleting, no json is being send through the request body nor sending something back into the response body. 

First, check if the city exists.

Then, get the poi that I want to delete.

Then call the delete method of the repo and save the changes. if everything is ok, send back a no content.

# Adding the delete in the repo
Add a method to delete the poi in the interface repo. This is NOT an async method, deleting is like adding, is an in-memory operation. But detail the add poi is async, and that's becase in that implementation we call get city async which is an I/O operation. 

However, the delete method cab be async, it depends on the method implementation. The examples shows both approaches are possible, with or without async.

Then add the implementation in the repo, just calling the delete method on the poi
