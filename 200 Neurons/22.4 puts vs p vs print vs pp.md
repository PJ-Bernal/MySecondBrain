[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

>[!important]
>Both commands is that after printing whatever argument they are passed, puts and print both return nil.

## Print something vs return something 
`puts` prints something to the screen, but doesn't return what it prints. **Expressions do something and return something, this two things are different** because the return value is not necessarily the action that was performed. Every time an object receives a message, it returns a response.

>[!multi-column]

>In this example, the return value of `puts "stuff"` is `nil`, so a gets assigned nil like this `a = nil`. Detail the empty space is being printed because I'm telling Ruby, print what is in a, but a is nil, so it prints nothing and then return nil.

## Puts

>The method prints whatever value passed adding a new line after,  and it return nil.. This method calls an object's `to_s` method internally. Puts its useful when my program needs to print something to the screen.

### Puts in functions 
>[!multi-column]

>Careful when using puts in functions or classes as the last line and I want to use the return value of that function.  
>%% %%
>Detail how the numbers are displayed, but the variable is referencing nothing.

>def numbers
>  puts 123

>x = numbers
>puts x.class
># 123
>#nilClass

## p and inspect
>[!multi-column]
>
>>[!info] Inspect
>>It returns a string that is a representation of the object itself: a representation that is as close as possible to the code that you use to create the object. This method print a newline character after each value. 
>>
>>```ruby
>>puts ["pizza", nil, "potato"].inspect
>># ["pizza", nil, "potato"]
>>puts "A string".inspect
>># "A string"
>>```
>
>>[!info] p
>>Coding `puts something.inspect` is quite a work, so Ruby implement the `p` method It calls an object's `inspect` method instead of its `to_s` method. This method is implemented like so:
>>
>>```ruby
>>def p(object)
  puts object.inspect
end
>>```

>[!important]
>- The return value of `p` is the value of the object passed into it and will not return nil.
>- p is also useful for debugging and what the code is really doing. 
>- inspect is available on any object in Ruby. 

```ruby
def debug(value)
  p value
end

debugValue = debug("hi") # this line will print "hi" and debugValue will equal "hi"
puts debugValue == "hi" # true
```

### P in functions 
>[!multi-column]
>
>Because p **has a return value** that is the object itself. I can use it as the classic return statement of a function. 
>%% %%
>Detail how the numbers are displayed, but the variable is referencing nothing. 
>
>```ruby
>def numbers
>  p 123
>end
>x = numbers
>puts x.class
># 123
>#Integer
>```

### puts vs p
Puts prints the variable, not in its raw version; detail how the output for numbers and strings is the same 

```ruby
$ irb
> puts 123
123
> puts "123"
123
```
## Print
Print keep this in the same line, don't print a new line. It will internally call an object's `to_s` method and return nil.
```ruby
print [1, 'hi', nil]
#[1, 'hi', nil]
```

I can use print with many statements to be printed on a single line:

```ruby
print 1,2,3
#=> 123
```

## pp or pretty printing
The method `.pp` prints big hashes and arrays in a nicer way.
