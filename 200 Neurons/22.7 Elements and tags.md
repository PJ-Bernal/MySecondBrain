[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML]]

## HTML tag
A tag is used for creating an HTML element. The name of an element is the tag name that appears at the element's start and end. For example, `p` in the `<p>` start tag and `</p>` end tag, is the name of the HTML paragraph element

Using the correct tags for content is called semantic HTML. 

### Void elements

>Elements that don't have closing tags because they are void of any content, like `<br>` or `<img>`. No closing tag, no element to wrap.

>Self closing tags like `<br />` or `<img />` are not longer needed, at the moment, they are being used for historical reasons.

Tags begin or end an element in source code, whereas elements are part of the DOM. 

## HTML attributes
