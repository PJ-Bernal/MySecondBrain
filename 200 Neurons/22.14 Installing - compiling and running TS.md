[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

# Install TS
Install TS to make TS available in any project using `npm install typescript --save-dev`, this will add a TS compiler (tsc) to compile TS into JS, this is because Node and the browser don't understand TS. 

Is recommended to install TS for each project, so each one, if required, can use different versions of TS. 

# Compile TS
Use `npx tsc` (becasue TS was installed locally for the project, and not globally) followed by the flags and files to compile. The `--outDir` flag allows to specify a folder for all compiled TS to JS files, add the files to compile so: `tsc --outDir js app.ts`

## Compile on save
The compiler will compile every time the file is saved `tsc --outDit js --watch app.ts`

# Run TS (JS)
Switch to the folder that contains the transpiled TS code and run `node <file name>`.
