[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

# Install TS
Install TS to make TS available in any project using `npm install typescript --save-dev`, this will add a TS compiler (tsc) to compile TS into JS, this is because Node and the browser don't understand TS. 

Is recommended to install TS for each project, so each one, if required, can use different versions of TS. 

Or better use Volta. 

# The tsconfig.json file
This is the tsconfig's boiler plate:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "dist",
    "target": "ES2015",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

The configuration in this file avoid to type certain flags and make the process a bit faster, so instead of `yarn tsc --outDit dist`, just `yarn tsc`. 
- `outDir`: indicates the directory output after compilation.
- `target`: what language level do I want, ES2015 is the minimum for this.
-  `moduleResolution`: leave it as node. 
- `include`: what TS is going to compile, in this example everything within the src directory. 
# Compile TS
If using volta and yarn, then compile with `yarn tsc`, or `tsc --outDit js --watch app.ts` so every time the file is save it will be compiled

After the TS code is compile, the `outDir` directory will have the transpiled JS code. Detail how different it is when changing the target. 

This is ES2015.

This is ES2022, the code is almost the same.

## The declaration file
Detail there's no type information in the transpiled JS. That information is available in the declarations files `.d.ts`. To create it, add the  `declaration: true` to the `tsconfig.json `

Including this declaration file is important for the developers using the code base to inform them about the types use within the code base.
