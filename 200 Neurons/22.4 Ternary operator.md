[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Follows the syntax: `conditional statement ? <execute if true> : <execute if false>`. 
If the executable conditions are large, I should use a regular if conditional. 

>[!info] To keep in mind
>- The ternary should use to choose between two options and no two actions. 
>- The expression should be assigned to a variable, passed to a method as an argument or return by a method. If not, use a regular if.

```ruby
foo = hitchhiker ? 42 : 3.1415    # Assign result of ?: to a variable
puts(hitchhiker ? 42 : 3.1415)    # Pass result as argument
return hitchhiker ? 42 : 3.1415    # Return result
```

This is innapropiate as I'm choosing actions:

```ruby
hitchhiker ? (foo = 42) : (bar = 3.1415) # Setting variables
hitchhiker ? puts(42) : puts(3.1415)      # Printing
```
