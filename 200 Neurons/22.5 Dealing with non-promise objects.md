[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

I can implement a JS class that return a promise when the expression accompanying `await` is not a promise-based. This feature allows for better integration with libraries or APIs that may use Promise-like objects rather than actual Promises.

In this example the class creates an object that has a then method, thus, `await` calls then automatically, expecting a Promise either resolve or reject. In this case, await is not using a true Promise instance, thus, the code can use any object with await. 

```js
class Thenable {
  constructor(num) {
    this.num = num;
  }
  then(resolve, reject) {
    alert(resolve);
    // resolve with this.num*2 after 1000ms
    setTimeout(() => resolve(this.num * 2), 1000); // (*)
  }
}

async function f() {
  // waits for 1 second, then result becomes 2
  let result = await new Thenable(1);
  alert(result);
}

f();
```
