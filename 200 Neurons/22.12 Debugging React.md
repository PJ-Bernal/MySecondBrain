[[12.12 React|React]]

The React developer tools from Chrome analyze the component's tree structure, allowing to verify if the component is receiving the correct props and holding the correct state (in real time, during interaction), address performance issues and inspect context values. 

## The components tab

Having the project running, open the developer tools and search for the components tab which will be showing the app's hierarchy tree. 

It shows the props, its state and any potential hooks being used inside the component.
