>Thinkin in terms of DDD is thinking about organizing the code along certain well-defined boundaries like the following.
## Bounded context
Natural division within the business, separate direct (the book store) or indirect (the warehouse) context from each other. Bounded context answer to the following question: What are the responsibilities of the people working within that context?

Meaning, people on each context do their job without thinking too much about other context, by communicating with each other, within a given context. So, things that happens insisde the context, stay inside the context.

Things go wrong when objects on both sides talking to each other without any reagrd of the context boundaries. So, to grant a clear and well-desing communication between context, DDD allocate the responsibility for communication between context to one small object (one person on the store communicate to one persone on the warehouse).


### Entity

Individual person within a context, it could be think like an object or class in OOP.

[question:: what is an entity, what is an aggreagate, what are their differences]


## Ubiquitous language
Within a given context, the people who work in that context use a language of their own, thus, the language of one context is different from the others. For example in the context of store the languge could be: authors, view, length, etc. Warehouse: weight, size, shelf, etc.

This language differ not only to talk about nouns but also to verbs, actions. The context I do to books is different depending on the context I'm in. (Store, talking about verbs: sell, shelf, organize; warehouse: pick off, box books).

Formalizing those ubiquitous languages is an important part of DDD, and the languge itself will be reflected within the code. 

Is important to distinguish between actors (people) an roles (tasks). For example, a boss is also an employee, but that doesn't matter, I want to focus on the role. 

One of the main goals of ubiquitous languge is to identify roles for entities, for people. Thus, the entities will be named after those roles, not the actor at an specific scenario. The entity are the roles a person has, not the persol itself. 
## Same name different, entity
Thinking about the implementation, I could think of modeling as a relation database. I could model the entities like in the picture. I have context that contain things that are obvious contain within that context; but, outside of the context I have entities that are independent and somwhow have to work in multiple contexts at the same time. In DDD this is bad.

Is bad because in DDD every entiti should be associated with only one context, and, for example order, is associated with two. Additionaly, orders and customer will be treaten differently depending on the context and their language.

This is a DDD design. Detail the warehouse and store context each have their own oreder, product and customer entities, and they are all different. Detail how each context has their own product, BUT they have a common attribute SKU, that linked them; this is becuase the product is exactly the same in both contexts; but customer and order are totally different on each contexts. 

So, DDD moves away from the relational databaswe thinking of trying to make giant components that could be used everywhere. Is a bad thing to have a single entiti that could be use in multiple context. And, every entiti should be associated with one context only. Everything is context sensitive.
