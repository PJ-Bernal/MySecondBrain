[This](https://www.pencilandpaper.io/articles/ux-pattern-analysis-enterprise-data-tables) is the complete article, here I just cover half of it. 
## Working with data
### When the data is text
- Data and column headers should always be left-aligned.

- Don't evet use center alignment. 
- Avoid duplication: if several data elements have a common word, use that word on the header instead of repeating it in all data rows.

### When the data are numbers
- Use right alignment for numbers, unless using dates, or phone numbers.

## UI design principles
### Column separators
>[!multi-column]
>
>- Try to use separators of 1px mas and a light grey color. However, they are not always visible.

### Rows
#### Division stripes
>[!multi-column]
>
>- Rows are the core of tables, so consider using zebra stripes, altering between white and light grey.

>[!multi-column]
>
>- However, using zebra stripping is not always recommended as the user could have different colors based on multiple table status like disable row, hover, focused and active.

### Vertical alignment
>[!multi-column]
>
>- Always try to use center-align if the text has no more than 3 lines.

>[!multi-column]
>
>- If the text has more than 3 lines, use top alignment.
