[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

I can implements both type aliases and interfaces, however, when implementing, the thing I implement to must be an object. If the type is an union type that represents a static member, that's not an object, I can't implement.

In this example, can bark 2 return type could be an object or a number, that's not possible.

Interfaces will be always compatible with the implements keyword.
