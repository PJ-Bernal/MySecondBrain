# About http client
Some method's implementation make calls into an API, if the method is test as is, isolation is broken, and the unit test become an integration test. API calls must be avoided when creating a unit test.

Http client creates a custom message handler that short-circuit the actual call to the API. This client is a go-to class for sending and handling the requests to APIs using message handlers (implementations of the http message handler class). 

The handler is an object that accepts an http request message and return and http response message. 

Each handlers have an implementation that allow them to behave differently, meaning, not all handler send  request over the network, a handler can only manipulate the request headers. 

Writing a custom implementation of the handler allows to use http client in unit tests, by short-circuit the actual call to the API by instead, returning a response that can be used in the test. 

What the custom handler must do is "mock" the call to the API, so if the API call brings an object of type employee salary, then, the custom handler need to return the same thing without calling the API. 
# Unit tests with http client
When a method use another method or its implement directly call an API, use the http client approach to the method. 

This method's implementation use another method that makes a call to an API.

This is the method that calls to the external API.

## Create the custom http message handler
Add a directory and a class.

Then, I need to generate and return a response to avoid the call to the API. To make the handler more re-usable, add a boolean for the eligible promotion, so the handler can be used in test for employees that are and are not eligible for promotion.

According to the API call, after the call, the API deserialize the response body to a `PromotionEligibility` type, meaning, this is the object I need to create in the custom handler. This object came from a created class in the API directory.

Detail the object is created using the back end property of the custom handler class `_isEligibleForPromotion`.

Then, manually create the response, returning it from the method.

## Writing the unit test
Arrange by creating a new http client instance, passing the custom handler, passing true to indicate whenever a call is make with the http client, it will return a response. 

Then create an internal employee. And finally new up the promotion service, that is the class that contains the method I'm testing, passing the http client.

Then act and assert.
