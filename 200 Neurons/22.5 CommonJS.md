[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

CommonJS is a module system for Node, thus browsers don't understand the syntax; that works a bit different than plain JS modules. It uses the keywords `require` and `module.exports` instead of `import` and `export`. 

However, plain JS modules are gaining popularity in Node.
