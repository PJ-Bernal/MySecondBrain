## Declaration vs initialization 
JS; religiously declares and then initializes variables, however, either step can be accomplished separately or simultaneously.

## What is hoisting
>JavaScript **Hoisting** refers to the process whereby, before any code execution, the interpreter appears to move the _declaration_ (**not** the initialization) of functions, variables, classes, or imports to the top of their scope (global, function or block), prior to execution of the code.

Hoisting is the first phase (memory creation phase) of the Execution context, JavaScript allocates memory for variable declarations and stores function definitions before executing the code. When the code is executed, variables and functions are already accessible due to the hoisting mechanism.
## Undefined
A variable gets the value of `undefined` in two cases:
1. The variable is declare and initialized with `var`, thus, when is hoisted, gets `undefined` as value; check [[22.5 Variable hoisting - declaration vs initialization - hoisting functions - hoisting classes - nested functions#^afe767|this example]]. 
2. The variable is declare and not initialized using var or let, it gets automatically assigned the value of `undefined`. Const 

```js
let a;
var b;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
//undefined
//undefined
```

In the rest of scenarios, for example, if a variable is being called first and then assigned when using let; that will produce different errors. 

## ReferenceError
This is an error when trying to access a variable that has not even been declared (don't even exists in the current execution context). Or the variaable is hoisted, but holds no value, not even undefined [[22.5 Variable hoisting - declaration vs initialization - hoisting functions - hoisting classes - nested functions#^ab3a68]]

## Hoisting variables

}

// ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization at test
// Variable is hoisted, but is uninitialized, it doesn't have undefined 
```

## Hoisting functions - nested functions
When a function is declared in the main script, is part of the global context, therefore, I can use the `window.myFunction()` syntax to invoke it. 
### Function declarations
They are hoisted to the top of their scope (only "one level up"). Child functions are **not** executed. 

>[!multi-column]
>
>>```js
>>hoisted(); // Output: "This function has been hoisted." - Thanks to hoisting I can use the function here
>>
>>function hoisted() {
>>console.log('This function has been hoisted.');
>>};
>>```
>
>>```js
>>printHello()
>>// hello
>>printDillion()
>>// ReferenceError: printDillion is not defined
>>
>>function printHello() {
>>console.log('hello')
>>
>>    function printDillion() {
>>        console.log("dillion")
>>    }
>>}
>>```
>>

>[!done|float-left]
>```js
>printHello()
>// hello
>function printHello() {
>  printDillion()
>  // dillion
>  console.log('hello')
>  function printDillion() {
>  console.log("dillion")
>  }
> ``` 




In the second example, `printDillon()` is only hoisted one level up, which is within the scope of `printHello()`. Therefore, it can be invoked in the global scope and the `ReferenceError` is triggered as the function hasn't even been declared. 
### Function expressions
They are not hoisted.

```js
expression(); //Output: "TypeError: expression is not a function
var expression = function() {
  console.log('Will this work?');
};
```

No matter if I'm also declaring a function.

```js
expression(); // Ouput: TypeError: expression is not a function.
var expression = function hoisting() {
  console.log('Will this work?');
};
```

```js
foo(); // Uncaught TypeError: foo is not a function
var foo = function () { }

bar(); // Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'bar' before initialization
let bar = function () { }

baz(); // Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'baz' before initialization
const baz = function () { }
```
However, noticed in the code above, the compiler hoists the `var` declaration (`var foo`), not the function assignment (`function () {}`). Therefore, the error shows JS knows about the existence of foo, but doesn't know what it is when was called.




## Hoist good practices
- Declare variables and functions before their use, hopefully at the beginning of their scope.
- Use `let` and `const` for block scope; avoid use of `var`.
- Avoid reliance on hoisting, unless is extremely necessary. 
- Use function expressions over declarations, they offer more control over variable declarations. 

### What happened with undeclared but initialized variables?
They only exist until the code initializes them, NOT hoisted, but they become global variables, only accessible after its declaration line. Declared variables are hoisted inside of their own scopes, thus, b is not defined.

```js
console.log(a); 
function hoist() {
  a = 20;
  var b = 100;
}
// Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined --  The function has not been called yet

hoist(); // function called, a is not global
console.log(a); 
// Output: 20

console.log(b); 
/*
Since it was declared, it is confined to the hoist() function scope.
We can't print it out outside the confines of the hoist() function.
Output: ReferenceError: b is not defined
*/
```

## Order of precedence
>Function declarations are hoisted over variable declarations but not over variable assignments.

>[!multi-column]
>
>>[!example]- Variable declaration and init, over function declaration
>>```js
>>let double = 22; // Init and declared
>>function double(num) {
>>return (num*2);
>>}
>>console.log(typeof double); // Output: number
>>```
>
>>[!example]- Variable declaration over function declaration
>>```js
>>let double; //only declared
>>function double(num) {
>>  return (num*2);
>>  }
>>  console.log(typeof double); // Output: function. 
>>```

## Hoisting classes
### Class declarations
Class declarations are hoisted just like const or let, therefore, it remain inaccessible until init. (the undefined error is not present, so the interpreter knows the class exists). 

>[!multi-column]
>>```js
>>var Frodo = new Hobbit();
>>Frodo.height = 100;
>>Frodo.weight = 300;
>>
>>console.log(Frodo); // Output: Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'Hobbit' before initialization
>>
>>class Hobbit {
>>  constructor(height, weight) {
>>  this.height = height;
>>  this.weight = weight;
>>  }
>>  ```
>
>>```js
>>class Hobbit {
>>  constructor(height, weight) {
>>      this.height = height;
>>      this.weight = weight;
>>   }
>>}
>>
>>var Frodo = new Hobbit(); //Here the Hobbit class is init
>>
>>Frodo.height = 100;
>>Frodo.weight = 300;
>>console.log(Frodo); // Output: { height: 100, weight: 300 }
>>```

### Class expressions
They are not hoisted. 

>[!multi-column]
>
>>```js
>>var Square = new Polygon();
>>Square.height = 10;
>>Square.width = 10;
>>console.log(Square); // Output: TypeError: Polygon is not a constructor
>>
>>var Polygon = class {
>>constructor(height, width) {
>>this.height = height;
>>this.width = width;
>>}
>>};
>>```
>
>>```js
>>var Square = new Polygon();
>>Square.height = 10;
>>Square.width = 10;
>>console.log(Square); // Output: TypeError: Polygon is not a constructor
>>
>>var Polygon = class Polygon {
>>constructor(height, width) {
>>this.height = height;
>>this.width = width;
>>}
>>};
>>```

The correct way: 
```js
var Polygon = class Polygon {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
};
var Square = new Polygon();

// Class has been declared and initialized, thus, it can be used

Square.height = 10;
Square.width = 10;
console.log(Square);
```

## Examples
### Var don't have block scope
 This means that variables declared with var are accessible within the entire function in which they are declared, regardless of block boundaries like loops or conditionals. They are hoisted to the top of the function. 
 
```javascript
function example() {
    var x = 10;
    if (true) {
        var y = 20;
        console.log(x); // 10
        console.log(y); // 20
    }
    console.log(x); // 10
    console.log(y); // 20 (accessible here because var is function-scoped)
}
example();
```
### Variables are hoisted first in their context and no code is executed
>[!example|float-right-medium]
>```js
>var a = 10;
>var b = 50;
>console.log("This is the first b: " + b); // 50
>
>function sum(){
>    // var b - hoist because var is function, not block hoisted
>    console.log("This is b: " + b); //Undefined
>    if(!b){
>        var b = 100;
>    }
>    return b;
>}
>console.log(sum()); //100
>```

Within the if statement, b is false, because the first var declaration is global scoped. Thus, the `return b` should print 50, however 100 is being returned.

This is because, when the interpreted enters the function allocates memory for all variables. `var` is function, <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">not block scope</mark>, thus, `var b` is hoisted to the top of the function sum and is assigned undefined, the if is true and 100 is assigned to b.



Detail in the example, a and b are in the [[22.5 Scope - how it is defined - global, local, function, block scope - variable shadowing - scope chain - lexical scope - nested scope#Global scope|global scope]] so they can be use anywhere. Additionally, let is block scoped, therefore is not hoisted to the top of the function.

```js
var a = 10;
var b = 50;
console.log("This is the first b: " + b); // This is the first b: 50

function sum(){
    // let b is not hoisted here
    console.log("This is b: " + b); // This is b 50
    if(!b){
        let b = 100;
    }
    return b;
}
console.log(sum()); //50
```
### Undefined variables are global variables NOT global scope
>[!warning|float-right]
>```js
console.log(x);
function trial() {
  x = 5;
  console.log(x);
}
trial(); 
// Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined

Here `x` is not defined and a ReferenceError appears because the for the first console log, the variable declaration `x` is hoisted, but has not been initialized.  

This means, that after the function is called, the variable exists. 
<br>
>[!done|float-left]
>```js
>console.log(x); // Undefined
>// console.log(y); // Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined
>function trial(){
>    console.log(x);
>}
>trial(); // Undefined
>var x = 5;
>trial(); // 5
>y = 5
>console.log(y); // 5. 

Detail y is not declared, and being called at the beginning only produces an error. However, it can be used after its declaration. 

Detail as well trial is being called after the x init, and after that x now exists and is being returned. 
<br>
<br>

###  var reassigned each other within the same context of execution
>[!multi-column]
>
>>```js
>>function varTest() {
>>    var x = 1;
>>    console.log(x); // 1
>>    {
>>        var x = 2; // same variable
>>        console.log(x); // 2
>>    }
>>    console.log(x); // 2
>>    }
>>varTest();
>
>>```js
>>function letTest() {
>>  let x = 1;
>>  {
>>       let x = 2; // different variable
>>       console.log(x); // 2
>>  }
>>  console.log(x); // 1
>>}
>>```

As the interpreter allocates memory, it first allocates for `x = 1`, and as soon enters the block, hoists the declaration assignation `var x = 2` to their scope, that is the function, and reassigns the variable to 2. 

This confirms, `var` is function scope and `let` and `const` are block scope. 


### Var use cases
- Var can be use if I must use a variable that is within a block or function, outside that function. 

>[!multi-column]
>>```js
>>let a = 'Hello';
>>
>>function greet() {
>>    // local variable
>>    let b = 'World';
>>    console.log(a + ' ' + b); ////Hello World
>>    if (b == 'World') {
>>        // block-scoped variable
>>        let c = 'hello';
>>        console.log(a + ' ' + b + ' ' + c); ///Hello World
>>    }
>>    // variable c cannot be accessed here
>>    console.log(a + ' ' + b + ' ' + c); // Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined
>>}
>
>>```js
>>let a = 'Hello';
>>
>>function greet() {
>>    // local variable
>>    let b = 'World';
>>    console.log(a + ' ' + b); //Hello World
>>    if (b == 'World') {
>>        // block-scoped variable
>>        var c = 'hello';
>>        console.log(a + ' ' + b + ' ' + c); //Hello World Hello
>>    }
>>    // variable c cannot be accessed here
>>    console.log(a + ' ' + b + ' ' + c);  // //Hello World Hello
>>}
