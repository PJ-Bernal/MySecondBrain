[[12.2 The internet]]

The browser is in charge of sending the request always. The server is in charge of send a response always (that could be resolve or rejected). 

## Simple request
However, the browser decides whether to allow JS to work with the data **based on** the CORS headers. 

## Unsafe - preflight request
In the case of [[22.2 HTTP security#Preflight|preflight request]], If this preflight request doesn't receive appropriate CORS headers, the actual request isn't sent.

## No-cors request
This mode tells the browser, "I know this request might not have CORS headers, but send it anyway." The browser sends the request but severely restricts what your JavaScript can do with the response.
