# About middleware
Middleware are software components that assembles into an app pipeline to handle requests and responses.

When a request is receive, it travel to a set of middleware components (the middleware or request, pipeline). 

The pipeline is configure in `program.cs` which consist on a set of middleware components that will work on the request to create a response. Each component can look into the request, modify, pass it on to the next component, or generate a response. 

>Each component chooses whether to pass the request on to the next component in the pipeline or not. Hence, the order of the middleware in the pipeline is extremely important.

At the end of the pipeline is the endpoint middleware which is going to call the code that generates a response, the code I write. 

Once the response is generate, it'll travel through the pipeline (in the other direction), so middleware components can see the response and also change it again. 

ASP.NET Core comes with many components, also they can be hardcoded. 

# How a middleware component works
![[Pasted image 20250119165849.png]]

The example detail only how the static file middleware component works. If the request is an image, the request will encounter eventually the static file middleware which will generate the response and the endpoint middleware won't be reached!!

Detail, once a component generates a response, the request is short-circuited and beyond middleware components are not trigger, the request won't travel further through the pipeline. This improve performance and decrease the server load.
