[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

Switch statements take a single **expression/value/element** as an input, and then look through several cases (that also could be a value or expression) until they find one that matches that value. Useful to compare a value with multiple variants. 

>[!important]
>- The expression's result is checked for a **strict equality** to each case value. 
>-  If the equality is found, switch starts to execute the code starting from the corresponding case, until the nearest break (or until the end of switch).
>- The default case is not required.

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case choice1: // if (x === 'value1')
    // run this code
    break;

  case choice2: // if (x === 'value2')
    // run this code instead
    break;

  // include as many cases as you like

  default:
    // actually, just run this code
    break;
}
```


>[!example] With no breaks
>```javascript
>let a = 2 + 2;
>
>switch (a) {
>  case 3:
>    alert( 'Too small' );
>  case 4:
>    alert( 'Exactly!' );
>  case 5:
>    alert( 'Too big' );
>  default:
>    alert( "I don't know such values" );
>}
>// Exactly
>// Too big
>// I don't know such value
>```


>[!example]
>`choice` refers to the expression/value the switch expressions could be. 
>```javascript
const select = document.querySelector("select");
const para = document.querySelector("p");
>
select.addEventListener("change", setWeather);
>
function setWeather() {
  const choice = select.value;
>
> switch (choice) {
>    case "sunny":
>      para.textContent =
>        "It is nice and sunny outside today. Wear shorts! Go to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.";
>      break;
>    case "rainy":
>      para.textContent =
>        "Rain is falling outside; take a rain coat and an umbrella, and don't stay out for too long.";
>      break;
>    case "snowing":
>      para.textContent =
>        "The snow is coming down â€” it is freezing! Best to stay in with a cup of hot chocolate, or go build a snowman.";
>      break;
>    case "overcast":
>      para.textContent =
>        "It isn't raining, but the sky is grey and gloomy; it could turn any minute, so take a rain coat just in case.";
>      break;
>    default:
>      para.textContent = "";
>  }
>}
>```
## Case grouping
When the same code is executed for several cases.
```javascript
let a = 3;

switch (a) {
  case 4:
    alert('Right!');
    break;

  case 3: // grouped two cases
  case 5:
    alert('Wrong!');
    alert("Why don't you take a math class?");
    break;

  default:
    alert('The result is strange. Really.');
}
```
