Linter are tools that scan the code with a set of rules and report errors, in some case they auto-fix this errors. There are multiple JS linter, but the most famous is ESLint. Check [the documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started) to know how to install and configurate it. 

For the extension, if the project contains an ESLInt configuration file, then the plugin will use this file.
