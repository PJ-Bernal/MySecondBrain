## Count lines and words
`wc` return the number of lines and words in the file or files pass as parameters.

The `-l` option only show the amount of lines.

Also the `-m` and `-w` options show the number of characters and words, respectively. 

>If the command gets stuck, for example `wc -l` with no arguments, `ctrl + c` can be used to get out of the command. 

## Capturing output from commands - cat
`wc` can be redirected with the argument `>` that tells the shell to redirect any of the shell return into a file; so, nothing is printed. If the file don't exists, the shell will created; and if its already created it'll overwrite what ever information (this could cause data lost).

>Redirect shell outputs to the same files is not a good idea as the content could be overwritten or incorrect (`sort -n lengths.txt > lengths.txt`)
### cat 
That stands for 'concatenate', prints the contents of files one after another.

A more useful command, `less`, display a screenful of the file content. I can use spacebar or b to move up or back pages and q to quit. 

## Filtering output - head - tail
`sort` command sort content of the file. No argument = sort alphabetically, `-n` option, numerically.

Here is an example of the redirect argument `>` and the `head` command that prints the specified (with the `-n` argument) first lines of content of the file.

`tail` command does the same as `head` from the end of a file instead. 

>[!example]- 
>head -n 3 animals.csv > animals-subset.csv
>tail -n 2 animals.csv >> animals-subset.csv

### echo and >>
`echo` prints text in the shell. If the command is redirected to a file, the echo argument will overwrite the file every time the command is executed.

However, the `>>` operator, appends the string to the file if it already exists; if not, it'll create it.

}

Using "" or ''  can be used to group string visually, when printing variables, the behave change.

## Passing output to another command
A command's output can be used for another command using the pipe `|`. This tells the shell the command on the right will use the output from the command on the left. 

By doing this I'm not required to create, for example, files that contain the metadata of the files within a directory as the first image use in this note. 

## Combining multiple commands
Chaining commands is possible and deletes the need for creating sorting or intermediate files.

## Command chaining vs redirecting

## Command chain for success!
Command chain is one of the reason why Linux is so famous; there is no real need to design complex programs, but lots of simple tools and steps to link. This programming model is call 'pipes and filters' (filters stands for any command that transforms a stream of input into a stream of output).
