[[13.4 Linux]]

Determine the start, pausing, resuming, scheduling and terminating of processes. Typically, processes don't run at the same time, although it seems they do it simultaneously.

Considering a one-core CPU system, many processes can use the CPU, but only one can actually use the CPU at a given time. In practice, each process uses the CPU for a small fraction of a second and pauses; then another process uses the CPU for a fraction, and so on. This giving up control of the CPU to another process is called context switching, and each time interval is called a time-slice. Each slice gives the process enough time for significant computation (maybe the process can finish the task in one time-slice), and it's that short humans don't perceive appearing to be multiple processes running at the same time (this means multitasking).

Here is a step-by-step when a process time-slice is up:

>[!tip]- When does the kernel run?
>It runs between process time slices during a context switch, saving the state of the currently running process and loading the saved state of the next process that is scheduled to run.

>[!explanation]- What if the system is multi-core?
>The kernel doesnâ€™t need to relinquish control of its current CPU in order to allow a process to run on a different CPU, and more than one process may run at a time. However, to maximize the usage of all available CPUs, the kernel typically performs these steps anyway (and may use certain tricks to grab a little more CPU time for itself).
