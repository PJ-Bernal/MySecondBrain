To throw a global exception, throw one outside of any try/catch block. ![[Pasted image 20250121134954.png]]

Detail the exception and the stack trace is logged out.

The stack shows that the first method the developer exception page middleware displays detailed information about unhandled requests exceptions. 

The same exception enables an exception webpage detail where the app is running in a **development** environment (that middleware only runs in development environment), and the app must be created using the webapplication.createbuilder.

# Exceptions in production
In production, the exception is shown in the console window, not in postman, or the webpage (is blank). To improve user experience, use the exception handler middleware.

First, add the `UseExceptionhandler()` at the beginning of the pipeline.

To let the end user know what happen to the request, without exposing the stack trace or any other development information, add the `AddProblemDetails` service.

The service standardize how error responses are return in the API, including the type, title, status, and detail. 

Now the app is in production and see how postman shows it.

The browser shows the same thing.

The above is useful even in development because the exception logged message in postman and the website is better.
