## How to break encapsulation using the API
With this AP I provides me the ability to introspect my classes, so I can access private attributes and methods. The first argument of the `ReflectionProperty` constructor is the fully qualify class name, the second argument is the attribute name.

Then, I have to set the reflection property accessible to true. And finally, I have to call the `getValue()` method from the Reflection class, whose argument is the object I want to know the value.

I can modify the object attribute using the `setValue()` property of the Reflection class. This method receives as the first argument the object I want to change the value from, and the value.
