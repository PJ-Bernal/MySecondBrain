## Return
>[!multi-column]
>
>Use to return the control of the program execution back to the environment it was called from. For example, in this example, when the function is being invoked, once the interpreter hits the return of the function, the control is returned to the script. 
>%% %%
>Within a function, it will stop its execution and return the given argument (that could be any kind of simple or complex expression). 
>%% %%
