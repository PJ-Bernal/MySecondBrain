A controller is a class that inherits from a base controller class (of .NET which came with lot of functionality). In MVC the controller class name is suffixed with Controller. 

The controller is responsible of handling incoming requests invoking an appropriate method, called action or action method, that will return a view.  

To determine which view is going to be shown, ASP.NET Core use a convention. 

>[!important]
>Following the convention of creating a view subfolder for each controller,  the view the index method is showing is index.cshtml, the same name as the action method.

# A detailed controller
A real controller do more than just returning a view. The controller is using the IPieRepository as one of its constructor parameters (detail the code no instance is created, but is DI who is behind the scenes providing the instance).

The List action method is returning a view but now is receiving some data that can be used by a view.
