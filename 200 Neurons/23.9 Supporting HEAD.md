# About the HEAD method
The HEAD method is similar to GET but without a return body, there's no response payload, only headers. Use to obtain information on the resource.

For a caching system, that might contain info on whether the resource is still valid, or check if the resource exists. 
# Adding support for HEAD
use the HTTPHead attribute on the Get method. There's no need to write another action  method for HEAD.

Be mindful when requesting this endpoint, **all the GET implementation** still be executed, which is not performant, but it helps with reduce bandwith.  

The response body is empty.
