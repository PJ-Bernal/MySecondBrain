Formatters don't look for style errors, but only format the code (spaces, indentation, etc.). There are several formatters, but Prettier is one of the most famous. [This](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) is the installation guide, and [this](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode) are the docs to set up and configure prettier within VSCode.
