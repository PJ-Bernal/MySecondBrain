## Composer JSON
This is the configuration file where I can put all my dependencies, and all other configurations (read composer documentation).

I don't have to use `composer require` to create composer.json I can use `composer init` to initialize the composer json file, then fill the vendors and version, and then run `composer install` to install those dependencies.  ^b0b9aa


## Require vs require dev
Require lists the dependencies for my project, they need to be installed in production. While require dev list the packages that are needed for development; the dependencies for require dev won't be installed if my package is being installed as a dependency for something else.

So right now I pulled in ramsey uuid, it only installed the packages that are in its `require` definition, and not anything else that is in `require dev` definition. However, if we were to add some kind of package dependency and require dev in our own composer json then when we run composer install it will install that as well, but you could pass arguments to the commands when installing  to tell composer whether to install dev dependencies or not.
