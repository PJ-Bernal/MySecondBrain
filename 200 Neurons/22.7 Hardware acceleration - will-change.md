[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

[This behavior](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/css-transitions/#hardware-acceleration-9) happens because of a hand-off between the computer CPU and GPU. 

For these rules: `transform`, `opacity` and `filter`, the browser will try to optimize the animation, transferring everything to the GPU as a texture, producing a performant animation; this is known as hardware acceleration. 

When this hand-off happens, between the CPU to the GPU and vice versa, the behavior (shown at the beginning) happens. To fix this use `will-change: transform`, and the browser will let the GPU handle this element all the time, and no more "snapping into place" will occur.  

```css
.accelerated.box {
    transition: transform 750ms;
    will-change: transform;
    background: slateblue;
  }
  .accelerated.box:hover,
  .accelerated.box:focus {
    transform: translateY(10px);
  }
```

## Not all properties can will-change
Only properties that can sub-pixel render can take advantage of the `will-change` rule:
- Properties that sub-pixel: `transform`, `opacity` or `filter`. Handled by the GPU, performing anti-aliasing and blend colors. 
- Properties that can't subpixel: `margin`, `padding`,  `width/height`, `top/right/bottom/left`. Layout properties 

If you need precise control over animations and want to ensure smooth transitions, it's generally safer to use transform for animations involving movement or scaling.
