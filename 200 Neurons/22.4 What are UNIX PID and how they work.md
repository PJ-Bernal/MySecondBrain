[[13.4 Linux]]

## How do processes work?
Any created process has:

![[Pasted image 20231201125507 1.png|center|350]] ^79fec6

- PID: (process ID) unique id number; used to manage the process. The first process Linux launch is [[22.4 systemd|systemd]]. 
- PPID: (parent process ID) unique id number of the parent that process was created by. E.i. parent PID 1, PPID child process 1.
- TTY: id of the terminal used to launch the process. [[22.4 Daemon|daemon]] is the term used when a process doesn't show a TTY (?), and runs in the background without a controlling terminal. 
- UID: (user ID) refers to the ID of the user that created a process. 

When a process closes, that PID is available for a new one and an exit code is generated; 0 is a clear exit, and anything else is a specific error. 

PID's are closely related to [[22.4 Levels and layers of abstraction#^fbb99f|name spaces,]] they hide parts of the system processes running in a different namespace (this powers containerization tools like Docker). At a certain point, the PID three stops at a branch, giving containerization, that branch restart with a PID of 1.
