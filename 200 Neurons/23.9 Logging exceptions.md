[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

Exceptions are generated by a try/catch statement. For logging exceptions logger methods provide an overload that takes an exception parameter. Because is an exception, this will be typically a critical level logger.

Unhandled exceptions will return a 500 status code, however, the exception is being handled just by logging it, and I have to return it using the status code method passing the status code and optionally a message. This implementation will go to the consumer of the API, and I must not reveal any implementation, so don't log the stack trace or something like that, therefore, the below messages are enough. 

log critical goes to the console, and status code goes into the response.
