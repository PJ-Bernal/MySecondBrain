## How the useState hook retains the state
When a component's state or props change, React re-renders the component which means it calls the component function **again** with updated props/state. Then React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one (this process is called reconciliation), and only the necessary changes are applied to the actual DOM.

React **preserves the state** between re-renders as long as the component stays in the same position in the tree. This is why hooks like `useState` can maintain state across renders.

During this process the component instance is not destroyed and recreated, if it were, all state and effect will be lost. 

Only if the component is completely removed from the tree, it gets unmounted.


In this example, every time the event is activated, with a click, the `Counter` function will be called, the **the state will be preserved**, not reset to 0. 

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  console.log("Component function called");

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
