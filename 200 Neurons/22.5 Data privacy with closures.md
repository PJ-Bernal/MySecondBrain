Closures can be used to create private variables and functions. There is no way to access or modify them like in CF, using dot notation. The only way is creating a method. 

The lexical scope is protected once the closure is created.

Here `count` is private and can be only accessed through the provided methods. 

```js
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    return {
        increment: function() {
            count++;
        },
        getCount: function() {
            return count;
        }
    };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.getCount()); // 1
console.log(counter.count); // undefined
```
