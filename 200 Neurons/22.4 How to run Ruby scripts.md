[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Ruby needs a Ruby runtime, that **is a program** that can execute Ruby code. To execute a script, within the UNIX shell, type: `ruby script.rb`. 

This program has other functionalities like:
- `ruby --version` to check the ruby's version.
- `ruby -e 'puts 123'` execute Ruby code without storing it to a file.

When using the Shell, the code is executed by an interpreter. 

>[!info] Infinite loops
>If the script gets catch by an infinite loop, I can scape that with ctrl + C.
