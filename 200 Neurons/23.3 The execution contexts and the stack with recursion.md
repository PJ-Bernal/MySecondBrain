## How recursion calls work
When a function runs, all its information is stored in an execution context, that is an internal data structure that contains details about the execution of the function (the current variables, its value, the value of this, etc.). 

>[!important]
>One function call has exactly one execution context associated with it.

>>1. The current function is paused.
>>2. The execution context associated with it is remembered in a special data structure called execution context stack.
>>3. The nested call executes.
>>4. After it ends, the old execution context is retrieved from the stack, and the outer function is resumed from where it stopped.

The key to understand how recursive function works is that the execution context is **remembered** so I have to for later usage!
## Step by step 
Having this code

```js
function pow(x, n) {
  if (n == 1) {
    return x;
  } else {
    return x * pow(x, n - 1);
  }
}

alert( pow(2, 3) );
```

### First execution context
The function is invoked, an execution context is generated: `Context: { x: 2, n: 3, at line 1 }` invoked by `pow(2, 3)`. 

Then a recursive invocation is present at line 5, thus, the current function `pow(2, 3)` is paused, the context **is the same** because the current function pauses, only the line changes because that's where the first recursive invocation was found. Therefore, the first context of execution is  `Context: { x: 2, n: 3, at line 5 }` invoked by `pow(2, 3)`. And the nested invocation happens.

`n` doesn't change to 2 in the first execution because when the execution was generated, this is, when in the line 9 the function was called, the argument pass to the function was 3. So, during this execution, n will be having the same value. 

In this example, the execution context variables for later use are `x = 2`.

### Second execution context
When the nested invocation happens, `n` has a value given by the first execution context (3), thus, when the recursive function uses n as an argument it changes its value to 2. The function is invoked, an execution context is generated: `Context: { x: 2, n: 2, at line 1 }` invoked by `pow(2, 2)`. 

Function stops and execution context is safe at line 5, so the context is `Context: { x: 2, n: 2, at line 5 }` invoked by `pow(2, 2)`.

### Third execution context
When the nested invocation happens, `n` has a value given by the first execution context (2), thus, when the recursive function uses n as an argument it changes its value to 1. The function is invoked, an execution context is generated: `Context: { x: 2, n: 1, at line 1 }` invoked by `pow(2, 1)`.

The recursive base complies, there are no more nested calls, thus, the third execution context is removed from the call stack and now, the return, 2, value of `pow(2,1)` is known. Thys, this value gets replaced in the second execution context.

Now, having remove the third execution context, the second execution is resumed, `pow(2, 1)` is know, therefore, the value of the second execution context `pow(2, 2)`, 4, is also known, and is removed from the call stack.

Finally I have the first execution context and the code knows the return value, 4,  of `pow(2, 2)`, therefore, the return value of `pow(3, 2)` is 8 and the call stack is empty and the return value of having execute  `pow(2, 3)` at line 9 is known.
