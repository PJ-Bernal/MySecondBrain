>Check [[22.5 Object design flaw|this note]] to remember the flaws that object design could have. 

To achieve inheritance I can wrap the properties in a init property name that resolves as a function. Also, when I use Object.create, all the methods of the parent are available.

```js
const Hero = {
  init: function(name, level) {
    this.name = name;
    this.level = level;
    return this; // Allows chaining
  },
  greet: function() {
    return `${this.name} says hello.`;
  }
};

const Warrior = Object.create(Hero);

Warrior.init = function(name, level, weapon) {
  Hero.init.call(this, name, level); // Call the parent's init method
  this.weapon = weapon;
  return this; // Allows chaining
};

Warrior.attack = function() {
  return `${this.name} attacks with ${this.weapon}.`;
};

const hero1 = Object.create(Hero).init('HeroName', 1);
console.log(hero1.greet()); // Output: HeroName says hello.

const warrior1 = Object.create(Warrior).init('WarriorName', 2, 'sword');
console.log(warrior1.greet()); // Output: WarriorName says hello.
console.log(warrior1.attack()); // Output: WarriorName attacks with sword.

```

In this case, I'm using only object literals, remember they don't have any `prototype` property, but the have properties, methods and the `[[Prototype]]: Object` directly from the Object object. 

The Object.create() static method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object. In this case, what is inherit is the prototype of the object itself rather than the  `[[Prototype]]: Object`.

## Object literal inheritance with arrow functions/FF
This another approach use object literals, arrow functions and FF to implement object inheritance.

```js
const proto = {
  hello () {
    return `Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`;
  }
};

const greeter = (name) => Object.assign(Object.create(proto), {
  name
});

const george = greeter('george');

const msg = george.hello();

console.log(msg);
```
