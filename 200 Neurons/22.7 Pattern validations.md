[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

I can use regex via `pattern = <regex>;` attribute. When utilizing pattern validations is a good practice to use the `placeholder` attribute to show users an example. 

Some input values, like email, don't accept the pattern attribute as they perform their own validations.
