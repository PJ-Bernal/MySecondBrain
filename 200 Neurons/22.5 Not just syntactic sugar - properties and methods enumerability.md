[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

Though classes do the same as object literals and constructor functions to offer a way to apply prototype inheritance, they still have certain differences.

## Classes need the new keyword to instantiate objects

>```js
>class User {
>  constructor() {}
>}
>
>const myUser = User(); 
>// VM168:6 Uncaught  TypeError: Class constructor User cannot be invoked without 'new'at
>```

Classes have a hidden property call `[[isClassConstructor]]: true` which the language check whenever the class is used. This not happen with functions, therefore [[22.5 What are factory functions - advantages of factory functions|FF]] are not require to use `new`.

## Class methods are not enumerable
Class methods enumerable flag is set to false, therefore, when looping the object with `for..in` or `object.keys()`, don't return those methods.

## Class always use strict
Strict is available automatically inside classes.
