# About models
Group of classes that make up the domain data and the logic to manage the data (usually with a repository class). Part of the model are POCO classes.

The model handles the logic of the application to retrieve or store data. However, sometimes, the model doesn't even contain logic at all. 

The model should have a simple API that hides the implementation that works on the data. 

## About POCO classes
Plain Old CLR Objects, or Plain Old C# objects, are simple classes that don't have any dependencies or framework-specific base classes. They contain properties and some basic methods; and don't inherit from any special base class.

POCO classes represent business concepts/entities.

The model must provide a simple API to the rest of the app. 

The image shows the interface for the Pie repository, letting the app know what the repository is able to do. 

It defines a property, all pies, that returns an IEnumerable in Pie, containing probably all pies es in the data store. It also defines a method get pie by id.
