[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

The following are the naming conventions use within the code of AR:
- FK: `singularized_table_name_id`, e.g. `item_id`, `order_id`.
- PK: by default, AR will use an integer column named `id` as the table's PK (bigint for PostgreSQL and MySQL, integer for SQLite). When using Active Record Migrations to create your tables, this column will be **automatically created**.


There are more column name conventions detail [the documentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html#schema-conventions), that use reserve words.
