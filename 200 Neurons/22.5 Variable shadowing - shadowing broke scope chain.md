>>Shadowing could be illegal if a variable's scope interferes directly with another. In this case, var is function, not block scope, so the declaration is hoisted to the top of the code, triggering an error.

Shadowing is not a good practice as it could lead to ambiguity, unintended changes and unexpected results. 

## Shadowing breaks scope hierarchy
>[!multi-column]
>>```js
>>let points = 10;
>>function displayDouble() {
>>    let number = 2;
>>    number = points * number; // variable 'points' is accessible in the inner scope. Scope chain and hierarchy maintain.
>>    console.log(number);
>>}
>>displayDouble();
>>//20 - code works as expected
>>```

>>[[22.5 Scope - how it is defined - global, local, function, block scope - variable shadowing - scope chain - lexical scope - nested scope|Scope chain]] is broken when two scopes have a variable with the same name. When this happens, the inner scope will work with its inner-scoped variable, and the outer-scoped variable is never used. 


```js
let number = 10;
function displayDouble() {
  //a new variable is defined with the same name as the variable on line 1 - outer scope. Scope and hierarchy breaks. The inner scope has already a variable named number, so it works with it
  let number = 3;

  number *= 2;
  console.log(number);
}

displayDouble();
console.log(number);

//6
// 10
```
 

## Where can this happen?
Inside a call-back function.
