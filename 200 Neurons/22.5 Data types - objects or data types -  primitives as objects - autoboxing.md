[[12.5 Javascript|Javascript]] 

# Primary/primitive data types
A primary data type value or a variable (binding) is a **single data thing** representation (a string, a number, a boolean, etc.). It is **not** an object and has no methods or properties. 

However, a primitive value/variable (binding) can access properties or methods when JS uses a process called [[22.5 Autoboxing|autoboxing]] in which the primitive is treat as an indirect instance of a father "object class" (of the same type of its value),giving it access to all their father object instance methods.

The primitive values `"hi"` and `42.0` are auto-box as objects, therefore, they can use **instances methods** of their parent Object.

Thanks to autoboxing variables can also be used to call instance methods. 
```js
let primitiveString = "hello";
console.log(primitiveString.length); // 5

let primitiveNumber = 42;
console.log(primitiveNumber.toString()); // "42"
```

## Objects or data types
A primitive value is just that, a primitive. Once I use the dot notation, JS wraps it into an object as an indirect instance. 

Now, JS have [all of this objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects) that **represents** the primitive data types with instances or static methods or attributes. 
## Number
Represents integer and floating point numbers, and specific numeric values like infinity, - infinity and [[22.5 Numbers, NaN, casting, number as objects, number methods - string to number#NaN, not a number|NaN]].
## BigInt
Create numbers appending `n` to the end of an integer.

>[!example]
>```javascript
// the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
>```

## String
Check [[22.5 String creation, comparing strings, template literals, string to number, number to string|the string note]].
## Boolean
It has only two values, true or false. All comparisons will always return a boolean. 

```javascript
let isGreater = 4 > 1;
alert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")
```

### Truthy and falsely values
 All values are truthy except false, 0, -0, 0n, "", null, undefined, NaN, and document.all ^cca767

## Null 
Unique value that doesn't belong to any data type and contain only the `null` value. Is NOT a reference to a non-existing object or a null pointer; it just represents 'nothing' or empty. 

## Undefined
>[!multi-column]
>
>Unique value (like null) whose meaning is "value is not assigned" (produced when a variable is declared but not assigned). ![[22.5 Comparisons - null and undefined comparison and casting - null vs zero#^20fae0]]
>
>```javascript
>let age;
>
>alert(age); // shows "undefined"
>```

>[!important] Don't assign undefined to a variable
>Its possible to assign undefined to a variable, but is not a good practice as its reserved as a default initial value for unassigned variables. Is better to assign null.

## Symbol
Use to create unique identifiers for objects.
# Non-primary data type
## Objects
Objects store a collection of data and complex entities and have special properties and treatments.
