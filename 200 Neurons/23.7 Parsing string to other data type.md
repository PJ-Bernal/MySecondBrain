[[13.7 C Sharp|C#]]

To parse a string into another type, use the `.Parse()` member method of the type I want to parse.

```c#
string weight = Console.ReadLine();
double wage = double.Parse(weight);

bool active = bool.Parse("true");
```

If the value can't be parse, use the `.TryParse()` member method. If the value can't be parsed, it will result in a run time exception. The second argument `out`, tells, if the value can be parse, then parse it into a bool for a variable called b.
