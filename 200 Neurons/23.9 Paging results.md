# About paging results
API expose collections, in this case, cities and poi. Implement paging is a good practice, to avoid impact performance (I don't want to return 1000 cities in one response).

A succeed pagination need to go all the way through the underlying data store, meaning, pagination should start over there and not in the app. This can be done with referred execution. 
## How to paging in the request 
Paging is done via query string. The consumer should be able to choose the page number and size. `https://host/api/cities?pageNumber=1&pageSize=5`.

# About the page size
Page size need to be limited (the consumer can page size 1000). If no paging parameters are provided, the first page should be return by default. 

# Adding paging
The og code.

## Adding the paging parameters
Paging work with parameters, add those with default values, in case the consumer don't provide anything.

### Adding the max pag constant
To constrain the maximum page size, add a constant into the class. This should be done by all pagination for each collection, and should not be use one to all collections (I allow the user to get a max of 20 cities, but 30 poi per page)

Then, get the current page size

## Add the method to the repository interface and implementation

The pagination must be done at db level, and not at app level. 

The og code

### Adding pagination before the query executes
Add paging functionality last because the pagination must work on a filtered and searched collection. Done that first will case the where clause to be executed in a small set of data.

The `.Skip()` method bypass a specified number of elements in a sequence and then returns the remaining elements. For example, if page 2 is requested, the amount of items in page 1 are skipped.

`.Take()` returns a specified number of continuous elements from the start of a sequence. 

## Applying paging no matter if either the string query for searching or filter is empty

This piece of code returns all the cities if no string parameters are passed, no pagination is used here. 

So delete this piece of implementation

# Testing
## Check pagination requesting all fields
Regardless if my dataset contains a small number of resources (so I can't check if pagination is being done).

For example, requesting all the cities in the example return only three, there's no way to check if pagination is being done.

To check this review the sql statement in the terminal, which should include the `LIMIT` (control number of rows per page) and `OFSET` (skip previous pages)parameters.

>This confirm is the db responsibility to do the pagination, and all the fields are not sent to the app in memory. 

## Check pagination with a specific page size and number

Page 2

Is working because the cities are ordered by name, so the first fields should be antwerp.
