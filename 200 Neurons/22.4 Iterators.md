[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Iterators are methods that naturally loop over a given set of data and allow you to operate on each element in the collection. Usually, this is the prefer method to iterate over a collection of elements.

## each
`each` iterates over each element of the array/hash, in order, executing the code within the block; the value is assigned to a temporary variable within `|`. If the code is short, I can use the inline syntax with `{ }`.

All arrays and hashes have an each method. 

```ruby
names = ['Bob', 'Joe', 'Steve', 'Janice', 'Susan', 'Helen']
names.each { |name| puts name }
```

If the code is multi line, the block is defined within do/end.

```ruby
names = ['Bob', 'Joe', 'Steve', 'Janice', 'Susan', 'Helen']
x = 1

names.each do |name|
  puts "#{x}. #{name}"
  x += 1
end
```

## Times
Run a loop a desire amount of times, with no checking condition required. I can create a variable after `do` that act as a counter that I can use within the loop.

```ruby
5.times do
  puts "Hello, world!"
end

3.times do |number|
  puts "Alternative fact number #{number}"
end
#Alternative fact number 0
#Alternative fact number 1
#Alternative fact number 2
```

## Upto and downto
You can use these methods to iterate from a starting number either up to or down to another number, respectively.

```ruby
5.upto(10) { |num| print "#{num} " }     #=> 5 6 7 8 9 10

10.downto(5) { |num| print "#{num} " }   #=> 10 9 8 7 6 5
```

This is useful to step through a specific series of numbers or letters. 

## Step
Iterate a specific amount of times, but with a defined step.

```ruby
1.step(10, 2) { |i| print "#{i} "}
# 1 3 5 7 9
```

## each_index
Useful to iterate over the key instead of the value. Detail I'm using the classing `[ ]` syntax to access the value of the key. 

```ruby
array = [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100] 
array.each_index {|i| print "#{array[i]} "}
```

## each_with_index
Almost the same as each_index, but gives the possibility to work with both the index and the element.  The first argument is the value, the second is the index. 

```ruby
irb: 001 > a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
irb: 002 > a.each_with_index { |val, idx| puts "#{idx+1}. #{val}" }
1. 1
2. 2
3. 3
4. 4
5. 5
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
