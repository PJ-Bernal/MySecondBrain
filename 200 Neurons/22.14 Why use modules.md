[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]


- Modules encapsulate implementation details, allowing to expose a defined and think API for other modules to consume.
- Modules are reusable. 
- Create higher-level abstraction when designing the app, think the app as larger building blocks. 

Modules are an JS technology, therefore, I need to indicate the compiler which modules technology to use in the `module` property of the `tsconfig.json` file.
