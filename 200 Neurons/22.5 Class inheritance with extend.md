>A class can only have a single superclass, so multiple inheritance from tooling classes, for example, is not possible
## What is extend and how to use it
The `extend` keyword used in class declarations or expressions create a child classes.

```ja
class ChildClass extends ParentClass { /* â€¦ */ }
```

>[!important]
>- Any constructor that can be called with new and has the prototype property can be the candidate for the parent class. So regular functions, CF and classes can use extend.
>- Extend is interchangeable, meaning a function can extend to a class or to a CF.

```js
// Regular functions as fathers
function OldStyleClass() {
  this.someProperty = 1;
}
OldStyleClass.prototype.someMethod = function () {};

class ChildClass extends OldStyleClass {}

// Classes as fathers
class ModernClass {
  someProperty = 1;
  someMethod() {}
}

class AnotherChildClass extends ModernClass {}
```

>[!error]
>The `prototype` object must be an Object or null (object literals don't have a `prototype`, soo they can be fathers; in summary, no `prototype` means they can't extend).

```js
function ParentClass() {}
ParentClass.prototype = 3;

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {}
// Uncaught TypeError: Class extends value does not have valid prototype property 3
```

`extends` alter the `[[Prototype]]` of the child class in the following way.

The right side of `extend` doesn't have to be an identifier, any keyword that evaluates to a constructor can be use; this is how [[22.5 Mixins|mixins]] are created. 

```js
class SomeClass extends class {
  constructor() {
    console.log("Base class");
  }
} {
  constructor() {
    super(); // is inside of the constructor definition of the child class
    console.log("Derived class");
  }
}

new SomeClass();
// Base class
// Derived class
```

## super in the child class
The `super()` call in the constructor of a child class is always necessary when the parent class has a constructor, regardless of whether the child class use the parent's constructor parameters or not. `super()` calls the parent's constructor and initialize `this` for the child class (so, no super no this), therefore, `super()` must be called before any `this`. 

`super()` class the parent's constructor and binding its class public fields, after which the child class constructor can access and modify using `this`. 

When my father class has constructor parameters and I want my child constructor instances to have those parameters, I **must** include the parameters within the `super()` of my child class. In [[23.1 Open-closed principle|this example]] the child class needs both `fuelCapacity` and `fuelEfficiency` parameters, therefore, super have them. If the super statement is empty within the constructor declaration of the child class, then I can't use the constructor properties of the father class, check [[23.1 Liskov substitution|this example]] to check this. 

The name use within the `super()` statement can be whatever, but the first parameter of super will be the first of the father's constructor and so on. Also, when a parameter is within `super()` JS will automatically bind `this` of the instances to that parameter; meaning in the background do what the slight blue does.

The above can be seen here, where the code `super(color)`, but `this.color = color;` was never wrote and when creating an instance, I can use the color. 

```js
class Shape {
  constructor(color) {
    this.color = color;
  }

  getArea() {
    return 0; // Base implementation
  }

  describe() {
    return `This is a ${this.color} shape.`;
  }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
  // Constructor defines what Im going to use to build my child object
  constructor(color, width, height) {
  
    super(color); // Call the parent constructor, I can only use color when creating an instance of Rectangle
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }

  describe() {
    return `${super.describe()} It's a rectangle with width ${this.width} and height ${this.height}.`;
  }
}

const blueRectangle = new Rectangle('blue', 4, 6);
console.log(blueRectangle.describe());
console.log(`Area: ${blueRectangle.getArea()}`);
// This is a blue shape. It's a rectangle with width 4 and height 6.
// Area: 24
```

`super` allow access to the `prototype` of the object the method is attached to, allowing to call methods from father classes. 

```js
class Cat {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  }
}

class Lion extends Cat {
  speak() {
    super.speak();
    // I have access now to the prototype of the object that has the method, in this case the Cat class, thus, I can use the property name
    console.log(`${this.name} roars.`);
  }
}

const l = new Lion("Fuzzy");
l.speak();
// Fuzzy makes a noise.
// Fuzzy roars.
```


## Extend return value
The father class may return something from its constructor, however, the derived class must return an object or undefined, or a type error will be thrown.

```js
class ParentClass {
  constructor() {
    return 1;
  }
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
  constructor() {
    super();
    return 1;
  }
}

console.log(new ChildClass()); // TypeError: Derived constructors may only return object or undefined
```

>[!important]
>If the parent class constructor returns an object, that object will be used as the this value for the derived class when further initializing class fields.

## Extending an object to a class
`extend` only extend constructable functions. In the case of an object I have to use `Object.setPrototypeOf()`.

```js
const Animal = {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  },
};

class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

Object.setPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype, Animal);

const d = new Dog("Mitzie");
d.speak(); // Mitzie makes a noise.
```
