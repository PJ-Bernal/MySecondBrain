The logger is a built-in service, it doesn't have to be register, but logging providers (services that displays stores, etc. logs for example in the console, azure, etc.) should be configure.

To change that go to `appsettings.development.json` file. 

The default log level is information, so things with that level or high will be logged. The Microsoft needs to be warning or higher for a message to be logged. 

# Log something through the API
## Creating the logger instance via DI
In the controller, use DI to inject a logger instance. Detail the category name for the logger is the same as the file name (CityInfo.API.Controllers.PointsOfInterestController.)

## Creating a logger
Inside of an action method. There are several extension methods available for each log level; they are trace, debug, information, warning, error, and critical.

The console logger provider is one of the providers that was automatically registered by calling create default builder. This is the message once the request is done in post man.

Detail all messages are there, not only the one created by the request. To modify this, change the appsettings.json.

# Modifying appsettings.json
Add a controller to see only its message. Doing this only the last info (of the previous image) will be seen, this is because the default is warning, but the configuration is telling I want to see all logs from the city info controller.

# Extending the create builder
To change that, use builder.Logging. Clear providers method, clear all the providers and nothing will be log, then I can add the logging providers I want.
