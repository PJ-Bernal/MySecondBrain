[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

Use `scandir` to list all files and directories within a given path as an array. `__DIR__` is a magic constant to say 'use the current directory'.

In this case `.` refers to the current directory, `..` to the parent directory, the `index.php` that is the only file within that directory. They are automatically included when listing the contents of a directory using functions like scandir(). These entries are typically skipped when processing the directory contents to avoid unnecessary processing.

I can loop through this files then to determine what to do. 

```PHP
<?php
// Get the current directory
$directory = __DIR__;

// Scan the directory and get an array of its contents
$contents = scandir($directory);

// Loop through the contents and display them
foreach ($contents as $item) {
    // Skip . and .. directories
    if ($item == '.' || $item == '..') {
        continue;
    }
    
    // Determine if the item is a file or directory
    if (is_dir($directory . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $item)) {
        echo "Directory: $item\n";
    } else {
        echo "File: $item\n";
    }
}
?>

```
