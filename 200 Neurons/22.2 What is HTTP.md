## What is HTTP?
All files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) are sent from a server to my browser (client) by an <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">application protocol called HTTP</mark>. Protocol is the set of <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">rules</mark> that serve as a link between applications and the transfer of hypertext documents.

In the HTTP model, sometimes called request response protocol, the <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">client</mark> <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">makes a request</mark> ([[22.2 HTTP requests#What is a request?|See request definition]]) to a <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">server</mark> and <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">waits for a response</mark>. <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">Request-response</mark> are like <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">strings</mark> that follows a standard format machines can understand.  

### HTTP versions
Different HTTP versions are still being used:
- HTTP/1.0: has the ability to transmit stylesheets, videos, scripts and images.
- HTTP/1.1: has the ability to reuse established connections for subsequent requests. 
- HTTP/2: and the previous one are the most commonly used.
- HTTP/3: the latest version.
