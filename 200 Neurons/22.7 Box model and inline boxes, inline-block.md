## Box model and inline boxes
All of the above apply to block boxes. However with inline boxes, the `width` and `height` values are ignore, and the content box's dimensions can't be modified (whereas the standard box model).

Only the left and right padding, margins and borders push other boxes; not top and bottom properties.

>Detail the width and heigh are ignored, and the top and bottom margin, padding and border are respected but don't change the relationship of the other content to our inline box.
