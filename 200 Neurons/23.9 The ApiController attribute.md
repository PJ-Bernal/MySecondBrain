[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

The attribute can be apply to a controller class. It is required for attribute-base routing, and error happens, a `ProblemDetails` object is returned, returning a 400 bad request is return on invalid input. 

# Binding source attributes

The attribute also helps with the model binding rules that fit the API, this means, the API can look at the request body, or the URI, so, how does the api know where to look for information? 

Use the binding source attributes to the action parameters of the controller action methods, to tell ASP.NET Core where a certain value should come from.

The most common for APIs are from body, header, query and route.

For example, this implementation of the get author action method will gran the author id from the route instead of the request body.

>By default ASP runtime attempts to use the complex object model binder when no attribute has been applied, which pulls data from value providers in a defined order. 

The above means, even though no binding attribute is used, ASP is able to work because From Body is inferred from complex types. From Form is not infer for user defined types. 

Those four rules are not mandatory to hard-code action parameters, but binding attributes can be hard-coded if needed.
