[[12.6 Git and Github|Git and Github]]

## File states
Git has three main states for files: 

>[!multi-column]
>
>>Modified: the file has been modified, but not committed to my database yet. 
>
>>Staged: I have marked a modified file in its current version to go in my next commit snapshot.
>
>>Commited: the data is safely stored in my local database.

Additionally, files could be in the following two stages:
- Tracked: files that were on the last snapshot, this means, that have already been added to the stage area and committed at least once.
- Untracked: everything else file, file that weren't on the last snapshot. Git is not actively tracking the files, thus, any kind of modify won't be reflected in the repository. 

>[!info] new empty/not empty folders | git keep in upload folder
>When a new folder is created, Git don't track in any way the folder, until something new is created. 
>![[Pasted image 20231228132422 1.png]]
>Detail git status and VSCode not even 'colorized' the folder. Until I create a new file, that VSCode and Git recognize the file as untracked.

## Git project sections
The main sections of a Git project are the working tree, the staging area and the Git directory. 

>[!multi-column]
>
>>.git directory: or repository, where Git stores the metadata and object database of the project. This is what is copied when I `clone` a repository. 
>
>>Staging area: or index, an area in which all files are ready for a commit. It is a file, generally contained in my Git directory, that stores information about what will go into the next commit.
>
>>Working directory7working tree: a single checkout of one version of the project, where all files can be edited.

The working three is a single checkout of one version of the project, the files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on my disk to use or modify.
