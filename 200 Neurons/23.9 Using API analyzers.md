[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

To enable analyzers, open the project document.

After enable the that, is possible a series of warnings appear indicating which potential status code can be return by the API, but haven't been declared.

![[Pasted image 20250225150939.png]]

For example.

![[Pasted image 20250225151008.png]]

Now, I can use the intelisense to solve this, and it will add a produces default response type.

![[Pasted image 20250225151024.png]]

That will add a default section on each endpoint. It adds a default response with a problem details body for all codes that haven't been explicitly specified. 

![[Pasted image 20250225151135.png]]

For example, this endpoint has not define a 400, and a 406..

![[Pasted image 20250225151355.png]]

Now then sending a put (update) and author, with an invalid request body, and the accept header was text/plain. The id is valid. 

![[Pasted image 20250225151817.png]]

The response is a 406.

![[Pasted image 20250225151838.png]]

Now, if I left the same body, but change the accept header to application/json.

![[Pasted image 20250225151935.png]]

if I send the request again, detail Im getting another status code that is not documented, the 400, but this time is falling under the default response, because is showing a problem details object, but the 406 was not. 

![[Pasted image 20250225152156.png]]

This means the analyzers, allowing to show a default response, are a good starting point to analyze the controllers that have the api controller attribute apply to them. However, is up to me to explicitly show in the code all the status code an endpoints is able to return.

In this API, all controllers return common status code, so I can apply those at controller level.

![[Pasted image 20250225152432.png]]

To apply status code to all controllers I can add those globally. Open the program.cs and add filters.

The og code.

![[Pasted image 20250225152556.png]]

Filter is a collection, so items on that collection are applied to all controllers.
