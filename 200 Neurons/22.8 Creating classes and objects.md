[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

PHP has a generic class implementation called [[22.8 Std class and object casting|std class]] that I can use to create generic objects or cast variables of other data types into objects; Or I can build my own classes.
## How to create a class

>The recommended way is to have a single class per PHP file whose name is the same as the class.
## How to create an object
>Objects can be created within the same class file, right after the closing curly brace of the class, but that's not a good practice. 

>[!important]
>PHP has a default constructor method in case I don't make one. I don't require to define a constructor.

>Is better to create them into the main script, using the `new` keyword follow by the class name, and parenthesis (parenthesis is not always required, depend of the constructor, but is a good idea to have it).

>The previous error happens because `index.php` doesn't know where the transaction class exists, the file hasn't been loaded, the file must be explicitly include or require (unless I use namespaces or autoloading).

>[!info] When var_dump an object
>According to var_dump the data type is object and is an instance of Transaction.

>[!important]
>The constructor and destructor is the first thing called when the class gets instantiated (this is, when an object is created).
