[[13.1 OO Programming|OOP]]

One of the primary advantages of OO is that an object need not to reveal all its attributes and behaviors, it should only reveal the interfaces other objects must interact with. Encapsulation bundle attributes (they should be private), methods (some could be private), or any other class member inside of the object, restricting access to other object members. Only certain information will be exposed by the object. 

>[!example]-
>An object that calculates the square of a number must provide an interface to obtain the result. However, the internal attributes and algorithms used to calculate the square need not be made available to the requesting object.

Thanks to encapsulation, objects use access modifiers to interact throughout interfaces (public methods). The internal implementation of the object is hidden inside of the class, and the internal data inside of the object. 

[question:: do all attributes of a class be private?]

>[!info]
> Gilbert and McCarty state that the prime directive of encapsulation is that “all fields shall be private.” In this way, none of the fields in a class are accessible from other objects (if an object is a car, I don't want anyone to alter its engine).

>>[!warning]- Black boxing testing
>>![[Pasted image 20240108135514 1.png|300]] The methods and how the class work is hidden, and the class only reveals inputs and outputs. The app doesn't have to know how the request cookie method implementation to use it.

>>This is extremely useful as it allows to change the way an object works without changing the rest of the application, only the method's implementation. What if my cookie class now has three attributes? The attributes are hidden from the application, so that doesn't represent a problem and only the request method cookie change, and maybe the class to handle correctly that change. 

Different languages encapsulate different things, but to prevent a domino effect, a rule of thumb is to encapsulate as much as possible. 

>[!example]- 
Imagine a CookieJar class attribute that represents the number of cookies. When an instance of the class is created, encapsulation prevents the application from changing the attributes (number of cookies in this example) or methods of the class.

## Basis of encapsulation 
(Review [[23.1 Interface vs implementation|this]] note for more information about the interface and implementation) This two are the basis of encapsulation. 
### Interfaces
[question:: attributes are not part of the interface nor implementation] - According to [[23.1 Interface vs implementation]] Only the public methods represents the interface. 
[question:: the quote below opens the possibility to have public attributes, is this real and a good  practice?]

Interfaces define the fundamental means of communication between objects. Each class design specifies the interfaces for the proper instantiation and operation of objects, meaning when designing a class, a blueprint is required to outline how objects instantiated from that class should be created and operated. 

This involves specifying the constructors, methods, and other fields that collectively define the behavior and characteristics of objects created from the class. Access modifiers like public or private determine what is part of an interface.

"Only the public attributes and methods are considered the interface."

Any object behavior must be invoked by a message using the provided interfaces.  The interface should completely describe how users of the class interact with the class. In OO, only the public methods are considered the interface. The user shouldn't see any part of the internal implementation, interacting with an object solely through class interfaces. 

>[!info]- Data hiding
>Data hiding only works when attributes are declared as private, thus, they are removed from the interface. Only public methods are part of the interface. Declaring an attribute as public breaks the concept of data hiding.

Based on the first example of this note, the interface would consist of two pieces:
- How to instantiate a square object (how the object is created)
- How to send a value to the object and get the square of the value in return (how it operates)

Now, if a user needs access to an attribute, a return method is created. If he then wants to obtain the value, a method is called to return its value. Thus, only the object that contains the attribute controls access to it. This is the right control and it is vital when a problem emerges, instead of tracking all possible code that might have changed the attribute, the solution could be found in only one place, the setter. 

>Remember to check 'A model of the interface/implementation paradigm'
### Implementation
Only the public attributes and methods are considered the interface. The user should not see any part of the internal implementation, interacting with an object solely through class interfaces. Anything defined as private (in many cases methods can be private) is inaccessible to the user and considered part of the class's internal implementation, hidden from the interface. Following the square root example, the user doesn't care how the square is calculated, thus, the implementation can change, and it won't affect the user's code. 

In some cases is required to have hidden methods, removing them from the interface.  ^9e109e

>[!example]- Toaster and power plant
>![[Pasted image 20240110221452 1.png|center|300]]
>All the toaster needs to do to obtain the required electricity is to implement a cord that complies with the electrical outlet specifications; this is the interface between the toaster and the power company. The toaster doesn't care if it's a nuclear electric plant or a local generator.

>Remember to check 'A model of the interface/implementation paradigm'

[question:: Are the attributes part of the implementation?]
[question:: is the implementation the code within a method? or the whole method. Are private methods pure implementation?]
### A model of the interface/implementation paradigm
>[!multi-column]
>When writing a class a separate interface and implementation must be provided; that is: a way for the user to invoke and use the class (these are the two vital pieces that compound an interface), and the implementation (without the user knowing it's specifics) Based on the UML, the interface is the public methods (+), and the implementation the method that is private (-).

>>Detail not all the methods are public or private, meaning, not all of them are either part of the implementation or the interface. Also, because the attribute is private (users don't need its existence), we are hidden part of the implementation (thus, the attribute is part of the implementation). Interfaces are the only things the object reveals to the user to interact with.

>If the implementation were to change, you would not need to change the interface. (The user would get the same functionality using the same interface, but the implementation would have changed.)
