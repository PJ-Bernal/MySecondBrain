[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

Installing `npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server` this dependency allow to avoid running `npx webpack` after making changes in the source code. It bundles the code behind the scenes every time I save a file that's used in the bundle. 

I can use source map so any error messages refence files and lines from my code and not reference a single file in my bundle dist directory. 

After install, the webpack configuration file might look like this. First, add a source map setting `eval-source-map` as a `devtool` option. If this is missing: 1) error messages will match the correct files and line numbers in the development code). 2) The source tab in the devtools won't show the original untouched code. Adding source map will solve both issues.  

The `webpack-dev-server` dependency only auto-restart when it detect any changes to files imported to the JS bundle, so the HTML file is ignored. So, I have to add that file into the `watchFiles` and that's it. 

```js
// webpack.config.js
const path = require("path");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "main.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    clean: true,
  },
  devtool: "eval-source-map",
  devServer: {
    watchFiles: ["./src/template.html"],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./src/template.html",
    }),
  ],
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
      {
        test: /\.html$/i,
        loader: "html-loader",
      },
      {
        test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
        type: "asset/resource",
      },
    ],
  },
};

```

Finally, run `npx webpack server` will host our web page on `http://localhost:8080/`.
