[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

The `Gemfile.lock` file details the versions of all the dependencies of the project. 

## Why the `Gemfile.lock` is important
Knowing the versions of the dependencies is extremely important. For example, I create a project today, but then, 6 months later I want to run it again. Imagine i didn't save the gemfile.lock file and additionally, my Gemfile doesn't have any versions specify. 

So I run bundler that is going to install the latest versions (different from the versions I use for creating my project), and now my application is not working. 

So setting up the versions of the project is extremely important because if I don't have that information, how can I know which version my dependencies were? 

## Tracking third party states
Web applications also relay on external states, for example, a credit card process application called stripe. If this platform have a change, my code could work but not as expected. Therefore, I should also track the state of external 'dependencies'. 

So one good practice is to write my code for the application still runs even the external API is down or change dramatically. So, my code should not relay 100% in that external resource.
