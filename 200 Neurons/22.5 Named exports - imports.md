## How to export
To export something as a named export use `export` or `export { }` somewhere in the file (typically the end. The braces contain anything I can export).

```js
// one.js
export const greeting = "Hello, Odinite!";
export const farewell = "Bye bye, Odinite!";
export function myFunction() {
  // â€¦
}
```

```js
const greeting = "Hello, Odinite!";
const farewell = "Bye bye, Odinite!";
export { greeting, farewell };
```

## How to import
To import, write the things I want to import providing the path of the file. When using third-party libraries I can use the name of the library instead of the full file path.

>Template strings for file path are prohibited. Only single and double quotes are valid. 

```js
import { greeting, farewell } from "./one.js";

console.log(greeting); // "Hello, Odinite!"
console.log(farewell); // "Bye bye, Odinite!"
```

## Named imports are NOT object literals or destructing objects
Though they use the same notation, they don't use object literals or are using the destructing object syntax. Thus, I can't assume what's inside of the `{}` is an object literal. 

## Rename exports
To avoid name collision I can rename exports.

```js
export { myFunction as function1, myVariable as variable };
```
