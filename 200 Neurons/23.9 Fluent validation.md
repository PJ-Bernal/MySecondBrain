Then, use the constructor to add Rules telling how I want the entity to be validated. Rule has several methods that allow a descriptive way for validating. If the validation is more customizable, use the must async method.

Then register the service in the appliation service collection extensions. In this case, he created an interface for the application project, called I Application Marker, which is empty and is used to reference that assembly (this is called interface marker).
