## How to define constants
Constants can't be changed during the execution of a script. To declare, use the `define()` function that holds two parameters, the constant name and value or variable; or using the `const` keyword for classes or interfaces. 

>Dollar sign is not required when using constants. the constant name (case sensitive). By convention a constant should be name all in capital letters.

>[!example]
>```PHP
>define('STATUS_PAID', 'paid');
>echo STATUS_PAID; // paid
>const STATUS_NOT_PAID = 'not paid';
>echo STATUS_NOT_PAID; //not paid
>```

## Accessibility
Constants have a global scope and can be access from anywhere in the code; class constants have class scope and can be access using the Scope Resolution Operator `::`.

## `const` vs `define()`
- Scope: `define()` declare global constant access anywhere in the codebase. `const` is class scope.

>[!example]- Global vs class constant
>```PHP
>define('PI', 3.14159); // Global constant
>class Circle {
>    const AREA_UNIT = 'square units'; // Class constant
>    
>    public function calculateArea($radius) {
>        $area = PI * $radius * $radius;
>        echo "The area of the circle is $area " . self::AREA_UNIT;
>    }
>}
>
>$circle = new Circle();
>$circle->calculateArea(5);
>```

- Evaluation time: `define()` constants are evaluated at runtime, allowing the expressions to be used as values. `const` are evaluated at compile-time, meaning that they must have a constant value known at the time the code is parsed.

>[!example]-
>Constant is declare and defined when the code is being parsed, so the value is just known.
>```PHP
>if (...)
>{
>    const FOO = 'BAR'; // invalid
>    define('FOO', 'BAR); //valid
>}
>//I can't use `const` within loops or if else structures.

- Dynamic nature: `define()` constants can be defined conditionally or within functions, allowing for dynamic creation and modification of constants. `const` constants must be defined with a static value and cannot be modified or conditionally defined.
### Dynamic constant names
When using `define()` the name and value of the constant can be the variable value. For the editor is an error, but the code is functional.

## Check if a constant has been defined
Use `echo defined('name of the constant')` that will return a boolean, 1 if the constant has been defined. 
## Magic constants and PHP constants
Magic constants are intrinsic constant whose value can change depending where they're used. [Here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.magic.php) is the list of this magic constants. Additionally, PHP has other constants [see this](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php).
