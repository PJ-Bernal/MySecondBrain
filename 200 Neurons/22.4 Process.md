[[13.4 Linux]]

## Process
User program under execution; to check, use the `ps` command.

Number of processes change dynamically; they are isolated and don't interrupt each other's execution. Process context switching refers to the switching between two executing processes, is an expensive process because the kernel has to to save old registers and load current registers, memory maps, and other resources. 

Also, [[22.4 What are UNIX PID and how they work|PID]] are important within the process context. 
### Viewing a process
To see, `sudo ps -e`; to group use `|` as ps doesn't have a built-in search function.  `top` is another command that acts like a task manager.
## Types of processes
### Interactive
Run by the user in the command line.
### Batch
Process that are not associated with the CLI and are executed in units, groups, when the system usage is low. It run in the background and could be invoked by a [[22.4 Daemon|daemon]].

Interactive and batch process are not daemons, though they can run in the background. They differ from daemons as they involve human input through a terminal of control.

[[22.4 Daemon|Daemons]] are the last type of processes.
