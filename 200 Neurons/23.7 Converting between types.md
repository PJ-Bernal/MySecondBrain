[[13.7 C Sharp|C#]]

There are three methods to convert types: implicit, explicit (casting) and use helpers.

# Implicit casting
Typically used to convert between same type but different extension types, for example: `int a = 123456; long l = a;` Nothing wrong happens here, and detail the new type is being assign to a new variable. 

# Explicit casting
When the casting will modify the data in some way, explicit casting is required. For example: `double test = 123.4; int a = test;` this will trigger an error because the 0.4 is lost. Thus, an explicit casting is required: `int a = (int) test;` 

Explicit casting may cause runtime exceptions. Explicit ‘force’ a conversion to happen.
