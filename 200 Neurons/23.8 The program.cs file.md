[[13.8 ASP.NET Core|.NET]]

# About the program.cs file
Every ASP.NET Core apps start and run like console apps, meaning this file contains a main function that will **launch** the app; the static void main app, which translates to top level statements. The code in this file will run when the ASP.NET Core app starts. 

All code of this file is part of the main method and gets generated upon compilation. 

The code in this file will start the server to be able to listen to incoming requests, as well as code to configure the application.  

# About starting the server
Each ASP.NET Core app by default will host its own server called Kestrel.
