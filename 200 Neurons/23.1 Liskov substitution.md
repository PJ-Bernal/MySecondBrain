[[13.1 OO Programming|OOP]]

This principle states that objects of the father class should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without breaking the program. Thus, all properties and methods of the father class are expected to work **appropriately** for objects of the child class. So if I have an Animal and Dog class (which inherits from Animal), in every place I use Animal I should be able to use Dog without breaking the program. 

The subclasses must behave the same way the father class does, and they must be invariant, so what is true in the main class must also be true in the child class. Also, subclasses should not throw new exceptions unless those are exceptions of the main class.

A good use of LSP enables safe use of [[23.1 Polymorphism|polymorphism]]. 

An example showing the violation of this principle is the square and rectangle problem. Remember the user of [[22.5 Class inheritance with extend#super in the child class|super]] in the child class.

```js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }

  setHeight(newHeight) {
    this.height = newHeight;
  }

  setWidth(newWidth) {
    this.width = newWidth;
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
  // The constructor needs 
  constructor(side) {
    // I want to be able to call the width and height of the square, that's why my super include two parameter, though for a square they are all sides.
    super(side, side);
  }

  // Square doesn't override setHeight or setWidth
}

// Demonstration of LSP violation
function enlargeRectangleHeight(rectangle) {
  const originalWidth = rectangle.width;
  rectangle.setHeight(rectangle.height + 1);
  
  // This assertion should always be true for rectangles
  console.assert(rectangle.width === originalWidth, 
    "Width should not change when only height is modified");
  
  return rectangle.getArea();
}

// Test with Rectangle
const rect = new Rectangle(3, 4);
console.log(enlargeRectangleHeight(rect)); // Outputs: 15 (5 * 3)
// Assertion passes

// Test with Square
const square = new Square(4);
console.log(enlargeRectangleHeight(square)); // Outputs: 25 (5 * 5)
// Assertion fails silently (width changed unexpectedly)
```

The above code break LSP in multiple ways:
- For the rectangle, changing the height doesn't affect the width; but for the square, changing the height, affect the width, thus, both the height and width are both equal. Therefore, objects of the child class can't replace objects of the father class.

## Using composition/inheritance to comply with LSP
One tool to determine if the principle is being violated is asking if the child class has [[23.1 Composition|"is-a"]] relationship with the father class. So, the square is a rectangle? Not really.

I can use composition or a well-designed inheritance to not breaking the principle.

### Using composition
Composition is usually safer choice when I'm unsure of the 'is-a' relationship or when inheritance might break LSP.

In this example the Square class contains a Rectangle instance instead of inherit from it. The Square implementation grants its instance will have equal sides, and detail everything inside Square is using the "internal rectangle" instance created in the Square constructor, so inside Square I must define again the same methods calling the using this "internal" rectangle instance. 

```js
// Using composition instead of inheritance

class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, height) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

class Square {
  constructor(side) {
    this.rectangle = new Rectangle(side, side);
  }

  getSide() {
    return this.rectangle.width;
  }

  setSide(side) {
    this.rectangle.width = side;
    this.rectangle.height = side;
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.rectangle.getArea();
  }
}

// Usage
function printArea(shape) {
  console.log(`Area: ${shape.getArea()}`);
}

const rect = new Rectangle(4, 5);
const square = new Square(4);

printArea(rect);   // Area: 20
printArea(square); // Area: 16

square.setSide(5);
printArea(square); // Area: 25
```

### Using inheritance
When using inheritance the key is to think in terms of chunks or modules of code that can work by themselves but are capable of being attach to other pieces of code. 

In this example Shape is the common interface for all shapes, and the 'is-a' relationship is much clear. using inheritance allow to have a separate and independent implementation for each class, like in the case of Rectangle and Square that have independent implementations. 

The `printArea()` function demonstrates that both Rectangle and Square can be used [[23.1 Polymorphism|polymorphically]] where a Shape is expected.

```js
// Base Shape class
class Shape {
  getArea() {
    throw new Error("getArea method must be implemented");
  }
}

// Rectangle class
class Rectangle extends Shape {
  constructor(width, height) {
    super();
    this._width = width;
    this._height = height;
  }

  getWidth() {
    return this._width;
  }

  getHeight() {
    return this._height;
  }

  setWidth(width) {
    this._width = width;
  }

  setHeight(height) {
    this._height = height;
  }

  getArea() {
    return this._width * this._height;
  }
}

// Square class
class Square extends Shape {
  constructor(side) {
    super();
    this._side = side;
  }

  getSide() {
    return this._side;
  }

  setSide(side) {
    this._side = side;
  }

  getArea() {
    return this._side * this._side;
  }
}

// Function that works with any Shape
function printArea(shape) {
  console.log(`The area of the shape is: ${shape.getArea()}`);
}

// Usage
const rectangle = new Rectangle(5, 4);
const square = new Square(5);

printArea(rectangle); // Output: The area of the shape is: 20
printArea(square);    // Output: The area of the shape is: 25

// Demonstrate that LSP is not violated
function enlargeShape(shape, factor) {
  const originalArea = shape.getArea();
  
  if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
    shape.setWidth(shape.getWidth() * factor);
    shape.setHeight(shape.getHeight() * factor);
  } else if (shape instanceof Square) {
    shape.setSide(shape.getSide() * factor);
  }
  
  console.log(`Original area: ${originalArea}`);
  console.log(`New area: ${shape.getArea()}`);
}

enlargeShape(rectangle, 2);
// Output:
// Original area: 20
// New area: 80

enlargeShape(square, 2);
// Output:
// Original area: 25
// New area: 100
```
