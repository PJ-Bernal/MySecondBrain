[[13.7 C Sharp|C#]]

C# use breakpoints, allowing to hover over variables to know the type and value of a variable on a given time. 

The green button runs the application with the debugger attached, in which, the later 'host' the execution of the code, being trigger when a bug breakpoint is encountered. On the other hand, the `.exe` file runs without a debugger.
