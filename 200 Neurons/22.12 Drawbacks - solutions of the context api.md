[[12.12 React|React]]

## Drawbacks
1. Could case performance issues. Updating a component can cause all components consuming that context to re-render, even if the state remain the same. 
2. When dealing with multiple nesting, could make the code a bit hard to understand. 

## Solutions
1. Create smaller contexts instead of a large one that complement each other.
2. The Context API is not always the solution for nesting components; [component composition](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-component-composition/) could be another solution.
3. Use an external state manager like Zustand or Redux.
