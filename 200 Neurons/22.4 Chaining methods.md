[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Chain methods is possible because each method call is built from the **return value** of the previous method in the chain.

The chain goes from left to right, so reverse, join, capitalize is the order of execution. 

```ruby
phrase = ["be", "to", "not", "or", "be", "to"]

puts phrase.reverse.join(" ").capitalize
#=> "To be or not to be"
```

Detail I'm using a method to start the chain, so the entire expression `add_three(1).times { puts 'this should print 2 times'}` returns 2, so I can keep chaining this whole expression. 

```ruby
def add_three(n)
  n + 1
end
add_three(1).times { puts 'this should print 2 times'}
#=>this should print 2 times
#=>this should print 2 times
#=>2
add_three(1).times { puts 'this should print 2 times'}.class
#=> This should print 2 times
#=> This should print 2 times
#=> Integer
```

>[!important]
>Always be mindful of what the method is returning. In this case, the method is returning nil.
>```ruby
>def add_three(n)
  puts n + 3
end
>
add_three(5) 
>#=> 8 this is the output
>#=> nil is the return value!
>
add_three(5).times { puts "will this work?" }
NoMethodError: undefined method `times' for nil:NilClass
>```

If I want my method to print something and return it as well I can do the following; this allows me to chain.

```ruby
def add_three(n)
  new_value = n + 3
  puts new_value
  new_value
end
```
