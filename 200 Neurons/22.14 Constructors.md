[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

In TS there must be a single constructor per class.

TS allow accessor methods. The setter method don't allow to specify the return type.

 When the constructor use a property, I can create it and then pass it to the constructor, or, include it within the constructor parameter list with the accessor of public, this tells the compiler I want a property with the same name as the parameter.

# Static properties

# Access modifiers
By default all members are public. Private and protected exists.
