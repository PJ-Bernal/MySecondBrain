# Selecting the template
The MVC pattern is one of the most common ways to create an ASP.NET Core web API. Start by creating a project -> selecting the ASP.NET Core web API template. 

Project name: `<project name>.API`, solution name: `<project name>`. 

# The project file (csproj)
Though on the file explorer the project looks like a directory, is an actual XML file containing properties for the whole project.

## About the csproj file
- `Project`: is the top level XML element that serves as a container for other elements in the `.csproj` file, including the `SDK`, `<PropertyGroup>`, `<ItemGroup>`, etc. 
- `Sdk`: which by default is `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`, this property reference the ASP.NET Core shared framework called `Microsofot.AspNetCore.App`, that brings support for many common types used in most ASP.NET Core apps.
- `<PropertyGroup>`: contains general project properties. Important, the last property `ImplicitUsings` when enable it allows [[23.7 Custom types - BCL contains custom types - namespace - global usings#Global usings|global usings]].
### References to packages
Detail within the dependencies are two MS framework packages which implicitly import other packages. 

When a package is installed, a reference within the item group is created. 
- `<ItemGroup>`: use this property to add any require dependency. For example, the template only have installed the `Swashbuckle` package, therefore, it has only a reference to that package. 
## Update packages
Prior to start developing, update packages by right clicking dependencies -> manage Nuget packages -> updates. Or simply change the version number in the package reference. 

# Properties -> launchsettings.json
## Profiles
File that set the environment for local machine development, is not deploy and contains profile settings like http, https, ISS. 
### commandName
HTTP and HTTPS have `Project` as the `commandName` value. Thus, when using one of those profiles, the Kestrel web server will be used to launch the project. The second profile use IISExpress as web server.

>>### launchUrl
>>It default is swagger, hence, the API documentation will be shown when launching the app. 
>
>>### launchBrowser
>>Launch a browser every time the app is run. Set to false is better choice. 

## Another way to change the launch settings
Right click on project -> properties -> debug -> open debug launch profiles UI. Any change there will alter the json file.

# Doing some clean up
The template comes with a controller and weather forecast class. Delete those. Also delete the `<project name>.http`, this file is for testing, but is better to use postman.
