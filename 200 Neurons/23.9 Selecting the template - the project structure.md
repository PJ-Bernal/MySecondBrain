[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

# Selecting the template
The MVC pattern is one of the most common ways to create an ASP.NET Core web API. Start by creating a project -> selecting the ASP.NET Core web API template. 

Project name: `<anyname>.API`, solution name: `<anyname>`. 

# The project file (csproj)

Because of the template, only one package has been explicitly referred in the item group.

It's an implementation of Open API or Swagger, for ASP.NET Core. It provides a nice web UI that documents the API and allows to do some testing.

Detail the image shows under packages, the added swagger package.

## Update packages
Prior to start developing, update packages by right clicking dependencies -> manage Nuget packages -> updates. Or simply change the version number in the package reference. 

# launchsettings.json
## Profiles
File that set the environment for local machine development, is not deploy and contains profile settings like http, https, ISS. 
### commandName
HTTP and HTTPS have `Project` as the `commandName` value. Thus, when using one of those profiles, the Kestrel web server will be used to launch the project. The second profile use IISExpress as web server.

>>### applicationUrl
>>Select the URL for the app to run.

>>### launchUrl
>>It default is swagger, hence, the API documentation will be shown when launching the app. 
>
>>### launchBrowser
>>Launch a browser every time the app is run. Set to false is better choice. 

## Another way to change the launch settings
Right click on project -> properties -> debug -> open debug launch profiles UI. Any change there will alter the json file.

# Doing some clean up
The template comes with a controller and weather forecast class. Delete those. Also delete the `<project name>.http`, this file is for testing, but is better to use postman.
