[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

A class can have variables (properties) and functions (methods). Visibility of properties and methods must be define to either public, private or protected, that are defined by access modifiers.

- Public: means the attribute or method is accessible to everyone interacting with the object, even outside of the class. 
- Private: the property is only available and accessible within the class itself. 
## Properties
In this example, a transaction object was created using `$transaction = new Transaction()`; and then `var_dump($transaction);`

>[!warning] Default value of a not-assigned property
Detail NULL is the default value for properties, with one exception to this when using type hinting. 

Attributes should be private almost always. By doing this, only the class can make changes to the attributes. 
### Accessing public methods and attributes
To interact with the object public methods or attributes within the main script file, I must use the object operator `->`. When calling nested methods or methods of another classes like  [[22.8 Nullsafe operator#^8bf99b|this]], I can make the object operator nullable `?->`.

### Changing an attribute value
Because the attribute is public I can change the value.
![[Pasted image 20240311085132.png|center]]

In this case (and in many more) have the properties as public doesn't make sense; this can cause some bugs where amount is explicitly changed outside of the class. Only the transaction class should change the amount and description.

## Typed properties
New from PHP 7.4. I can set the data type of the property in the definition, though is not required is a good practice. 

As soon as the type hint was made, detail how the variable change from in to float.

### Uninitialized state
To solve the previous situation, the uninitialized state was introduced. So, when an attribute is type hint, but a value is not assigned to a property, it's in uninitialized state.

Detail I'm var_dump the class that is showing all the attributes, and the uninitialized state. 

![[Pasted image 20240311090957.png|center]]

If the type hint data type is remove, the NULL Is back. 

![[Pasted image 20240311091024.png]]

To solve the issue of accessing properties before initialization, a solution is to assign some kind of value  either directly in the definition of the attribute or in the constructor or setter. 

### Assign values to properties
Properties can hold values in it's definition that work as constants. They can't be functions or any kind of expression. 

![[Pasted image 20240311091333.png|center]]

If I want my property be initialized with the NULL value, I must use the [[22.8 PHP functions#Nullable values|nullable type]]. Because something was assigned to the property, the state is not uninitialized.

## Constructor
>[!important]
>PHP has a default constructor method in case I don't make one. I don't require to define a constructor. 

When a property is not a constant, meaning each object will have a different property value, constructor comes handy. 

Defining the access modifier for a method is not required, but is a good practice, if not present, PHP will assign public by default. 

The constructor method is a special function also known as a magic method that will called whenever a new instance of the class is created. Starts with `__`. To access properties of the class within the same class I must use a variable called `$this`, that refers to the calling object in other words, to the instance from which the method was called. 

Up to this point the constructor have parameters, but the constructor in the main script don't have any argument, thus, an error appears.

With argument in the constructor everything is fine.

>I don't have to type hint constructors' parameters. 

## Methods
Methods without access modifiers will be public.

![[Pasted image 20240311094005.png|center]]

When the properties are private, like in this examples, to access them a getter method is required. So instead of calling a property like in the image above, the object is invoking a method.

## Method chaining
When I want to built up the object before getting the final value (like in this example by adding the tax and then the discount) method chaining is handy as it allows to invoke several methods that return the object itself or a property. So, instead of hard code `$transaction->` for example, six times, method chaining improve readability. 

But not in all classes chaining methods is useful or required. 

Detail in the methods section (above), the `addTax` and `applyDiscount` aren't returning anything (to see how the attribute change I have to `var_dump($transaction->amount);`. 

>[!important]
>
>The chained methods must have a return value of any type. In this case I'm using `$this` (this will return the current object) which refers to the calling object which is the instance of the transaction class.

Because an instance of the class itself is being returned by the method, I can specified to the method the returning datatype by adding `: Transaction`, but I could use any other data type. 

![[Pasted image 20240311105956.png|center|450]]

This is how to chain methods. 

![[Pasted image 20240311110038.png|center]]

### Method chaining within a constructor
Or even combine object declaration with the method invoking like this. Detail the whole object declaration is a single statement, just with break lines to improve readability. 

![[Pasted image 20240311110428.png|center]]

### Bad practice
If a method don't have a return statement or is a getter, chaining won't make sense, because I need to return some kind of value not the current instance. 

>Also, not all classes require chaining methods.
