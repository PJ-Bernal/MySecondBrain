[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

Helps to define descendant rulesets of one element without repeating the father selector. To use nesting, symbols are required, like `&`, `.`, `>`, etc. (detail example 2); though `&` is not required, is a good practice to make the nesting more noticeable.

>The last nesting has two symbols, detail how using `.` only, the nested ruleset keeps working.

>[!warning]- Excessive nesting can cause problems with specificity or undesired behaviors

>![[Pasted image 20240221184045.png]]
>This makes code less readable and changing the specificity of the code. One level deep nesting is ok, two should be take with care. 

>[!info] For compound selctors
>>[!multi-column]

>>Nesting also work when the class name is compound `class: button primary`, `class: button accent` the `&` <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">is required</mark>.
>>%% %%
>>What CSS is doing is NOT concatenating strings, but building a concatenated selector, in this case, `.button.primary`

>By doing this I can have one selector and change the behavior of the HTML tag in a very specific way.

>[!warning] Regular declarations are hoisted to the top of the ruleset
>Declarations like: border, background, etc. Are hoisted up even though the at-rule is written on top.
