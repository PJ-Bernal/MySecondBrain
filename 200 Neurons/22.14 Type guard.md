# Narrowing - type guard
When dealing with optional parameters, object properties, etc. A type guard is required to let TS know which type I want to use for the next code block. 

A type guard, an if or switch statement, will let TS which type is going to be used for the upcoming implementation. In this example, the charge voltage property is optional, meaning it could be a number or undefined.

However, once it pass the type guard, TS knows is a number.

This is one example of type narrowing, in which the increase of the type specificity of a variable as the implementation of the function advances. This means **only** within the if implementation, charge voltage is a number type. 

The same happens when working with optional parameters, a type guard is required before even using the object. This happens because car could be undefined, so a type guard is required.

After the type guard, know TS will know car is an object of type car. Detail after the type guard, the car object parameter is not optional, is not `car?:`, but `car:`
