Http context is an object which encapsulates all HTTP specific information about an individual HTTP request, is like a container for a single request.

I can use that object in a controller to see all the details of a request, but in a test, I don't need that, only need an instance through the default implementation `DefaultHttpContext`. This is enough for most test, but if I need to manipulate the full object and not only some properties, use `Mock<HttpContext>`.
