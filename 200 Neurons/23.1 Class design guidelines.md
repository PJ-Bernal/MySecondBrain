## Modeling real-world systems
One OOP goal is to model real-world systems in ways people actually think, rather than using a structure, top-down approach when data an behaviors are logically separated, OO encapsulates data an behaviors within objects, with classes that modelos those objects and its interaction. Thus, the class desing should represents the true behavior of the object.

>Each class model a real-world entity; each object encapsulates thei behavior and data. And they interacti through each other's interfaces.

However, populate the user with just enough data using data transfer objects is not strange. 

## Identifying the public interfaces
One most important design guidelines is to maintain the interfaces to a minimum, just to provide the services the client wants. 
### Minimum public interface
Provide the minimum, the exact, public interface makes the class as consice as possible. Thus, is important the users are involved in the desing from the start and throughout the testing phase. 
### Hiding the implementation
The implementatoin shouldn't involve the users at all. A class is more useful if the implementation can change without affecting the users; a change to the implementation should not necessitate a change in the user’s application code. 

## Design robuts constructors (and perhaps destructors)
A constructor should put the object into an initial and safe state (initializating the attributes and memory managment), and probably into a default condition. 

[question:: Search about constructor injection.] - This is a good point at which to introduce the concept of constructor injection, where service classes are injected on object creation (via a constructor) instead of within the class (using the new keyword). For example, the cabbin can get his license object, his radio information object (frequency, call sign, etc.), and the key that starts his cab passes into the object via a constructor
## Desing error handling into a class
Errors should be anticipated with code that handles them. As a general rule, an application should never crash, when error is encoutered, the system should either fix itself, or at minimum, exit gracefully without losing any data. 
### Documentatin a class and using comments
Achieve a good desing is practically impossible without good documentatio practices, the class desing process must be documentated. 
### Build objects with the intent to cooperate
There is no reason to build a class if is not going to interact with other classes. So the design must be aware of how this class and its objects with interact with other classes.

## Designing with reuse in mind
This is not an easy task as predict all the possible scenarios is not a trivial task; however, code resuability is one of the most important things when designing a class.
## Designing with extensibility in mind
Adding new features should achieve by adding new methods and modifying current behavior, there is no need to rewrite everything. Thanks to inheritance, based on a Person class for example, a new class Employee can inherit from it; thus, Person class is said to be extensible. _I shouldn't want to design Person class with behaviors hat prevents it from being extensible_, for example, coding methods for a Supervisor within the Person class; what if Employee inherit methods for a supervisor?

Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. 

[question:By using interfaces first and coding to them, youcan use all sorts of patterns like Decorator to extend things without touching the code that’s been tested and deployed live,]

### Making names descriptive
The convention I choose is not as important as choosing one and sticking to it; also this convention must origin descriptive names. A good naming convention should be able to tell what the object represents. 

>Don't user extensive naming conventions and involve as much stakeholder as possible.

### Abstracting out nonportable code
>[!multi-column]

>Code that use nonportable (native) code must be extracted out of the class, in its own class or at least in its own method (that could be overridden); thus, my class should send a message to the wrapper class, to interface directly to get the information from this native code.

[question:: how to create this wrapper classes with native code. How my class with interface with this class? Regular methods?]

### Providing a way to copy and compare objects
Spend the necessary time designing a way to copy and compare objects.

### Keeping the scope as small as possible
To follow abstraction and implementation hiding, keep the scope as small as possible; thus, maintaining, testing and extending a class are much easier. 

>[!info] Scope and global data
>There is no global data in OO development, static attributes and methods are shared among objects of the same class, they are not available to objects outside the class. 

>[!multi-column]
>
>For example when using a temporary attribute for a method, there is no reason for it to be at the class level scope.

>```Java
>public class Test  {
>	int temp = 0; // This is bad
>	public int swap (int a, int b) {
>		int temp = 0;
>		temp = a;
>		...	
>	}
>}
>```


## Design with maintainability in mind
Design a class force to organize the code into ideally manageable pieces, separated, making the code more maintainable than large pieces of code. This is achieve reducing interdependency between code, this is, changes in one class have no impact or minimal on other classes.

>[!info] Highly coupled classes
>Highly dependent classes are known as coupled, one class change, the other does. 

Hence, well designed classes grants that any change in the system should be made only to the implementation of an object. Changes to the public interface should be avoided at all costs (they will cause a ripple effect throughout all the systems that use the interface).

>[!example]-
>If a method change, every single place in all systems that use that interface must be changed and recompiled (for example, the method signature could change from string to int).

### Using iteration in the development process
Don't write all the code at once, rather create increments and test. A good test uncovers any areas where insufficient interfaces are provided. Thus, keep iterating until the class has the appropriate interfaces.

### Testing the interface
The minimal implementations of the interface are often called stubs, they allow to test interfaces is working properly, without writing any real code, hence, temporary or dummy attributes could be used. At this point, the 'real' implementation is not needed. 

>[!example]
>Rather than use a real database, stubs are used to verify the interfaces are working properly; thus, implementation is not necessary at this point. In fact, question 3. 

[question:: search real examples of how a stub works, stub uses only dummy attributes? or methods saswell]
[question:: implementation is not necessary at stub point, how is that?]
[question::  it might cost valuable time and energy to complete the implementation yet because the design of the interface will affect the implementation, and the interface is not yet complete]
