[[13.4 Linux]]

>[!quote]- Abstraction is the most effective way to understand how an operating system works
>By ignoring the details of something and focusing on its purpose and operation; for example, when driving a car. Abstraction can be broken up based on the scope of approach (passenger vs copilot abstraction's scope is different).

Linux systems are complex, but abstraction allows us to concentrate on what the components do in relation to the whole system. 

>When building a software component, developers typically don’t think much about the internal structure of other components, but they do consider other components they can use (so that they don’t have to write any additional unnecessary software) and how to use them.
