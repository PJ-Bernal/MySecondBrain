[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Allows to call methods on objects without worrying the object ay be nil. If the object is nil, the method is not invoked and the result will be nil.

```ruby
# Call method `.profile` on `user` only if `user` is not `nil`
@user&.profile

# Equivalent to
unless @user.nil?
  @user.profile
end
```

Using with variables I must check if the variable has been previously defined. 

```ruby
# `user` local variable is not defined previous
user&.profile

# This code would throw the following error:
NameError: undefined local variable or method `user' for main:Object
```

To fix this:

```ruby
# Option 1: Check the variable is defined
if defined?(user)
  user&.profile
end

# Option 2: Define your local variable. Example, set it to nil
user = nil
user&.profile     # Works and does not throw any errors
```


## Operator apply to a symbol - enum shorthand
Appending the `&` operator to a symbol it will converts it to a Proc object; this means, it converts the symbol to a method. This is useful as a shorthand for enum methods that don't need any arguments.

```ruby
["11", "21", "5"].map(&:to_i)
["orange", "apple", "banana"].map(&:class)

# The same as people.collect { |p| p.name }
people.collect(&:name)

# The same as people.select { |p| p.manager? }.collect { |p| p.salary }
people.select(&:manager?).collect(&:salary)
```
