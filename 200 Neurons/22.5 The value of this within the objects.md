No matter where the method is found: in an object or its prototype. In a method call, this is always the object before the dot.

```js
// animal has methods
let animal = {
  walk() {
    if (!this.isSleeping) {
      alert(`I walk`);
    }
  },
  sleep() {
    this.isSleeping = true;
  }
};

let rabbit = {
  name: "White Rabbit",
  __proto__: animal
};
```

Now, when using `this`, that value is going to be substituted for the object in question. 

```js
rabbit.sleep();

alert(rabbit.isSleeping); // true
alert(animal.isSleeping); 
```
