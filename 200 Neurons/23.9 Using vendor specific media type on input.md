When inputting, the consumer can specify the type using the `Content-type` header. 

# Implementation
## db and authors age
Add the do death on the entity.

Then add a migration execute add-migration with a name, then execute it. 

![[Pasted image 20250207090306.png]]

Add the dto with the do death, make it derived from author for creation dto.

![[Pasted image 20250207090344.png]]

This class calculate the age.

![[Pasted image 20250207090447.png]]

Update that to take into accoutn the do death.

The update the authors profile. The og.

## In the controller
The og code.

The current signature is using a single action to create the author, but in this case the consumer can create an author and an author with do death. Copy the method and change the name and input parameters, the implementation of the method is the same.

Now, the controller need to be able to differentiate between those two actions depending on the content type header. Use action constrains, they allow to select an action depending on, for example, the content type header. 

Add a new folder action constrain and create a class that will be the action constraint attribute.  In the implementation: if no request header is found, throw a null exception, if there is store in a private read only field.  

![[Pasted image 20250207091237.png]]

Then parse the media types that result in a match, in a collection.

![[Pasted image 20250207091318.png]]

Then check if the inputted media types are valid. Import the s.net.http.headrs

![[Pasted image 20250207091336.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250207091421.png]]

Now to implement the IActionConstraint interface, right click on that, and then implement interface. 

![[Pasted image 20250207091500.png]]

Some code is added in the same file. The order property decides which stage the constraint is part of, action constrains group based on the order. 

![[Pasted image 20250207091525.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250207091650.png]]

Now use the attribute on the controller. Detail the create authro with dob is the oe that accept the new media type. 

![[Pasted image 20250207091746.png]]

Finally, use the consumes attribute to indicate which content type they can consume. The consume is differnt from the request herader matches media type, because that ensures routing to an action; it doesn't have anything to do with input or routing formatters. So both attributes are needed.

Another, without dob but with hateoas

With do death.
