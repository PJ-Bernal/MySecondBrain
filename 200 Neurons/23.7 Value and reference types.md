# Value types
All primitive values, enums, nullable (`int?`, `bool?`, etc.), and structs are value types, which the compiler will allocate a fixed size on the stack. Each type itself determines how much memory is needed to contain a value of that type. The value itself is placed in the memory. 

All primitive are value types, but not all value types are primitive. 

When a value type is copy to variable, the value itself is copy and bind to that other variable. In this example I have two variables with the same value, no reference types are involve, therefore, there are no pointers or anything like that. 

```c#
int a = 42;
int aCopy = a;
```
# Reference types
This types are allocated in the heap, thus, the stack won't contain the actual value but a variable with a pointer to the memory address on the heap where **the object** is allocated. What is allocated on the heap is the object, with all its properties, fields, methods, etc. Pointers appear when there are objects involve. 

The reference types are:
- Built-in reference types are: object, string, arrays, delegate.
- User-defined types: classes, interfaces, delegates, 

Classes follow this pattern, therefore, classes are reference types. 

## About classes/objects as reference types

When a reference type of a custom type variable is declared, the variable is created on the stack. However, because an object hasn't been instantiated, is pointing at nothing on the stack, is null.

When the object is not created, the source code can't use any field. However, the code will compile, and only a runtime exception, a null reference exception. 

```c#
Employee employee = null;
employee.PerformWork(); // runtime exception 
```

Only when the object is instantiated, the pointer knows where 'to point'.





Once an object is not needed anymore, I can assign its variable to null. 



# Reference vs value
This image shows the object is created on the heap, thus, the variable in the stack doesn't contain the actual object but a reference, a pointer, to the actual object on the heap.

>Remember C# is a managed language, so there's no need to clean up the objects for space.

```c#
Employee emp1 = new Employee();
emp1.firstName = "Ana";

Employee emp2 = emp1;
emp2.firstName = "Pablo";

string check = emp1.firstName // Output: Pablo
```
