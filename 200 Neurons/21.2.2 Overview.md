## How to use Dataview?
Dataview is a live index metadata query to search, display and operate on indexed data. **Is not meant for editing notes**. It has two building blocks: data indexing and data querying. 

### Data indexing
Dataview reads content in the yaml frontmatter or in the note with inline fields via key:: value syntax. 

### Data querying
Indexed data is accessible via queries in three different ways using:
1. Dataview Query Language: powerful toolbelt to query, display and operate data. 
2. Inline statement: gives the possibility to display a query result within the note, within a sentence!
3. Javascript query.

DQL consist of several parts:
1. Exactly one query type that determine how the query looks like.
2. None or one FROM statement to pick a source to look at.
3. None to multiple Data Commands to filter, group or sort data.
