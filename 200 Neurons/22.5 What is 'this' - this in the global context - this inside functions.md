[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

`this` refers to the current object the code is being executed in (the object that is currently calling the function). Thus, if a method is share across multiple object, `this` is able to interact only with that specific method.  

```javascript
const person1 = {
  name: "Chris",
  introduceSelf() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
  },
};

const person2 = {
  name: "Deepti",
  introduceSelf() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
  },
};

// this refers to person1
person1.introduceSelf()
// "Hi! I'm Chris.";

// this refers to person2
person2.introduceSelf()
// "Hi! I'm Deepti.";
```

>This is extremely useful when using CF, so I can create one method that can be use for all objects.

Since this adapts to the object on which the method is invoked, you can define a method once and reuse it across multiple objects.

```js
function sayHello() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
}

const person1 = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet: sayHello,
};

const person2 = {
  name: 'Bob',
  greet: sayHello,
};

person1.greet(); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
person2.greet(); // "Hello, my name is Bob"
```

## Using this as a self-reference variable
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```js
>let counter = {
>  count: 0,
>  next: function () {
>    return ++this.count;
>  },
>};
>
>counter.next();
>// 1
>```

Because `this` refers to the object that is currently calling the method, I can use dot notation to access one of its properties.

In this case when the `next()` method is called, the `this.count` in its definition is saying "go look for a property called count inside the object counter", and the increase the value.

Detail the example is using a [[22.5 Operands - operators -  expressions - chaining assignments#Prefixed operator|prefix operator]].


## This in the global context
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```js
>console.log(this === window); // true
>this.color= 'Red';
console.log(window.color); // 'Red'
>```

In the global context, `this` refers to the `window` object. Thus, if I assign a property to `this` it'll be applied to `window`.


## This inside a function invocation
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```js
>function show() {
>   console.log(this === window); // true
>}
>
>show();
>```

`this` refers to the `window` object. 

Also, remember the [[22.5 Variable hoisting - declaration vs initialization - hoisting functions - hoisting classes - nested functions#Hoisting functions|functions are hoisted]], therefore I could also invoke the function as `window.show()`. 

## This inside a method invocation
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```js
>class Example {
>  constructor() {
>    this.name = "John";
>  }
>  
>  sayHello() {
>    console.log("'this' is:", this); 
>    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
>  }
>}
>
>const instance = new Example();
>
>// Case 1: Calling it as a method
>instance.sayHello();
>// Logs: 'this' is: Example {name: "John"}
>// Logs: Hello, John!
>
>// Case 2: Calling it as a standalone function
>const justTheMethod = instance.sayHello;
>justTheMethod();
>// Logs: 'this' is: undefined
>// Error: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
>```

`this` refers to the object that is calling the method; the left side of the dot when calling a method. 


In this line, `this` is referencing the car object, thus the console is returning Honda.

Now, a method is an object's value, therefore I can store it in a value. However, the return value is undefined because the method is being invoked without an object, so `this` is referencing the `window` object.

However, I can use the `bind( )` method of the `Function.prototype` that allows to literally bind an object to a method, so when I call the method by itself, it already knows what object reference to.

```js
let brand = car.getBrand.bind(car);
console.log(brand()); // Honda
```

I can use that to bind to use the method in other object, like this example:

```js
let car = {
    brand: 'Honda',
    getBrand: function () {
        return this.brand;
    }
}

let bike = {
    brand: 'Harley Davidson'
}

let brand = car.getBrand.bind(bike);
console.log(brand());
```

## This inside a CF
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```js
>function Car(brand) {
>    this.brand = brand;
>}
>
>Car.prototype.getBrand = function () {
>    return this.brand;
>}
>
>let car = new Car('Honda');
>console.log(car.getBrand());
>```

For direct instances, `this` is referencing the created object, in this case, the object created with the argument 'Honda'.








## This in indirect invocation
Functions are first class citizens, meaning all functions are instances of `Function`, thus they can use all of their methods. So, I can call a function using an object as an argument with `call( )` and `apply( )`.

When using both methods, `this` is bond to the object pass as first argument in both methods. 

```js
function getBrand(prefix) {
    console.log(prefix + this.brand);
}

let honda = {
    brand: 'Honda'
};
let audi = {
    brand: 'Audi'
};

getBrand.call(honda, "It's a ");
getBrand.call(audi, "It's an ");
```

The `apply( )` method receives as a second argument an array.

```js
getBrand.apply(honda, ["It's a "]); // "It's a Honda"
getBrand.apply(audi, ["It's an "]); // "It's a Audi"
```

## This in arrow functions
`this` in arrow functions inherits the context of the outer function where the arrow function is defined. This means, arrow functions don't create its own context. 

```js
// Execution context is global, thus, this refers to the window object
let getThis = () => this;
console.log(getThis() === window); // true
```

Arrow functions don't have its own execution context, thus, I can define a method as an arrow function. Inside the `getSpeed()` method, `this` references the global object and not Car. 

```js
function Car() {
  this.speed = 120;
}

Car.prototype.getSpeed = () => {
  return this.speed;
};

var car = new Car();
console.log(car.getSpeed()); // ğŸ‘‰ undefined
```
