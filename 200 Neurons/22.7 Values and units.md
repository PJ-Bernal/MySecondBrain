[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]



>[!warning]
>- Not all CSS properties accept all kinds of units, some accept only px, but other px and rem, etc.
>- Generally, use rem for font sizes and px for almost everything else, however using both can break the layout so I ca use rem or px for everything.
# Numbers, lengths, and percentages
## Number units
Numbers have different units for CSS properties:
- integer: whole number such as 10, 548, -55.
- number: decimal number such as 0.58, -1.58
- dimension: number with a unit such as 45deg, 5s, 10px. Dimension supports: length, angle, time and resolution types.
- percentages: are always relative to another quantity, for example, an element's length is relative to its parent element's length. 50%.
## Length
### Absolute length units
Units that aren't relative to anything else, they keep the same defined size in any context. `px` is the only useful absolute unit. Use absolute units won't provide accessibility at all (rem and em change, px is static).
### Relative length units
Units that change based on their context (size of the parent, viewport, setting, etc.). They can scale the length of other units, providing responsive to the page. 
#### em
>[!multi-column]
>
>```css
.container {
  font-size: 16px;
}
>
.container p {
  font-size: 1em;
}
>
.container h2 {
  font-size: 3em;
}
>```
>
>The `em` unit means "**times, relative to the parent element's font-size**". The user-agent font size is 16px. 
>%% %%
>In this example, the font size of `p` is 16px, meanwhile the font size of `h2` 3 times the parent's font-size this is 48px. 
>%% %%
> Relying on em could mean that a particular size could change if the context changes, which is very likely not the behavior you want.


>[!example] If `em` is used with another property like `width`, `em` is calculated using the font-size of the parent.
>
>The container has a font-size of 16px, so the p element has a font-size of 32px, and its width is 96px.

#### rem
Stands for **root element's font-size**; this unit is not affected by a parent but for either `:root` or `html` of the document. With rem I don't care about the parent's font-size. 

>[!important]
>1. You’ll see rem and em, but as a rule-of-thumb, prefer rem.
>2. Use re to define the font-size of a website is recommended.

>[!multi-column]
>
>```css
p {
  font-size: 1.25rem;
  width: 2rem;
padding: 1rem;   
}
>```
>
>In most browsers, the default font size is 16, so the `font-size` of `html` elements is `16px`. So in this case, `p` is `20px` (16 * 1.25).
>%% %%
But if a user changes their browser's default font size, then the `font-size` of `p` will scale up or down accordingly. 

#### em vs rem example

>Detail how the first list font-size keep increasing, meanwhile the second just increase all of its elements by 1,3.

#### vw
Percentage of the width of the viewport, where `1vh` is equal to `1%` of the viewport width. 

>[!multi-column]
>```css
body {
  width: 100vw;
}
>```
>
>The body is set to 100% of the viewport, so if I resize the browser, the body will resize as well. 

It changes dynamically when the page viewport dimension alter, this provide 'an instant responsive'.

>[!example]
>![[Pasted image 20240131131331.png|center|550]]
![[Pasted image 20240131131349.png|center|550]]

>[!important]
>Another similar unit is dvh, that is dynamic vh. 
#### vh
The same as `vw` but with the height of the viewport, where `1vh` is equal to `1%` of the viewport height. 

>[!example] Percentage vs viewport units
>Viewport units and percentages are quite different, detail the purple div takes into account the viewport and not its container.
>![[Pasted image 20240617173834.png|center|350]]


#### vmin, vmax
A percentage of the viewport width or height, whichever is smaller or larger. Use this unit as a font-size will lead to troubles like [this](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pure-responsive.gif?resize=1024%2C442&ssl=1). 
#### ch
Refers to the character widht. Look [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48649169/what-is-difference-between-css-em-and-ch-units) for a use case for a ch. 

#### Line height units
`lh` and `rlh` are similar to `em` and `rem`, the firs is relative to the line height of the element itself, the second to the root element, usually `html`.

## Percentages

>They always be relative to other value, the parent's element value; it could be a value of any property, font-size, width, etc. Percentage can be 'inherited' like in the following example. Each li group is smaller and smaller.

>In this example, the second div is taking 50% of their parent this is the whole black box. The forth div is taking 50% of their parent that's the purple div.


# Color
It accepts color keywords (like `blue`, `white`, etc. Not recommended,), hexadecimal RGB values, and RGB values. The latter accepts a fourth value separated by a slash representing opacity, called the alpha channel of the color, from 0 to 1. 

>[!warning] Difference between alpha channel and opacity property
>When you use opacity you make the element and everything inside it opaque (first image), whereas using RGB with an alpha parameter colors only makes the color you are specifying opaque (second image).

# Images
The image value type can be an actual image file via `url()` function or a gradient. 

>[!example]- Image as a value of the background-image property
>![[Pasted image 20240131140211.png|center|250]]
# Position
Represents the 2D coordinates of an element, it can take words as `top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right`, and `center`, for example, `top: 10px;`. 

A typical position value consists of two values — the first sets the position horizontally, the second vertically. If you only specify values for one axis the other will default to center.

>[!example]
>In the following example we have positioned a background image 100px from the top and 40px to the right of the container using a keyword.

>![[Pasted image 20240617175849.png|center|350]]

>This is the case when only one axis is specify.

# String
CSS has `identifiers` that are words understand by the CSS engine that don't require quotes, they "are not strings", for example the keywords `red`, `blue`, etc.. However, other places can requires strings (quotes required), for example, when specifying generated content. 

>[!example]-

# Functions
CSS has functions like `rgb()`, `translate()`, etc. Additionally, CSS support math function that comes in handy and are other option to use JS for example. The most common function is `calc()`, that allows to do +, -, / and *.

## Combine values using calc()
A good use case is that calc() allow to combine different units, to create unique values that are impossible to represent with traditional CSS units. In this case, the calc puts a margin of 4rem between the navigation bar and the main content no matter how long or short the viewport height is.

## Restrict numerical values with clamp
`clamp()` define a range of possible values for a CSS property, that are evaluated and applied as the height and and width of the viewport change. The syntax: `clamp(<mininum-value>, <target-value>, <maximum-value>)`.

In this example the CSS is `h2 {font-size: clamp(1.75rem, 5vw, 3.5rem);}`. This means:
- In large screens, where the VP is more than 5vw, the font size will be 3,5rem.
- In smalls, where the VP is less than 5vw, the font size will be 1,75rem.

>This means the value always compute to a fix value either 1,75 rem or 3,5rem in this example.


![[Pasted image 20240617182942.png]]![[Pasted image 20240617183031.png]]

I also can use calc operations within clamp: ` width: clamp(100vw - 70%, 50rem, 70%)`. 

>[!important]
>Clamp provides certain responsiveness so I don't have to rely that much in media queries.
