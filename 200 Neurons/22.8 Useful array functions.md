[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

PHP has a lot of built-in functions to work with arrays. 
## `array_chunk`
Use to chunk an array into a list of smaller chunks of arrays. It has three arguments, the length and the last argument (optional) that is if I want to preserve keys or not. 

In this example, the helpers file contain this function.

>To preserve the keys, add `true`.

## `array_combine`
Creates an array bounding the given keys (first argument) and values (second argument); it will throw an error if the numbers of pairs is not the same. 

![[Pasted image 20240309192406.png|center|400]]

>Prior to PHP 8, when the number of pairs is unequal, a warning appears and the function will throw false instead. But in PHP 8, most of the internal functions throw an error instead of a warning.

## `array_filter`
Iterates over each array value and it passes the value to the given callback. If the return of that callback is true, then the value is return into the resulting array, otherwise, the element will be discarded. 

The first argument is the array and the second is the callable or callback function. In this case, the example is using the shorter arrow function syntax. Here, if a value is an even number, then it will remain in the array, if not is just discarded.

>By default, the value is pass to the callback (arrow function in this case) as the argument. But I can decide if I want to pass the arrays' keys. This is specified in the third parameter.

### Without a callback
Having an array as the only function argument will filter falsely values. 

![[Pasted image 20240309211111.png|center|500]]
## `array_values`
Allow to re-index the array keys numerically.  

![[Pasted image 20240309210839.png|center|500]]


## `array_keys`
Use to get the keys of the array, even when looking for specific values. Detail the return array have new indexed keys. 

![[Pasted image 20240309211237.png|center|500]]

>[!important]
>The loose comparison is made by default , but the strict ca be applied using `true` as a third argument.
>
>![[Pasted image 20240309211408.png|center|500]]

## `array_map`
Applies a callback to each element of the given array. In this case, by default the callback will use the values of the array.  The first argument is the callback, the second is the array.

![[Pasted image 20240309211717.png|center|500]]

>[!important] Two or more array re-index
>When the function takes more than two arrays as arguments, the keys will be re-index numerically.
>
>![[Pasted image 20240309212136.png|center|500]]
>
>Using a single array as an argument will preserve the keys. 

>[!warning] Arrays of different length
>The callback will be applied in parallel, so, when using the function with arrays with different number of element, the shorter array will be extended to an empty element.

### Using null as callback
When using null, the function will merge one by one the keys of the arrays to create new arrays.

![[Pasted image 20240309213003.png|center|500]]


## `array_merge`
Merge multiple arrays. 
### Numeric keys
If the arrays have numeric keys (same or different), it won't override the values but instead they will be appended. Numeric keys will be re-indexed.

In this case, all the keys are numeric, so the values are appended and the keys are re-index. Also detail the values are NOT getting the specified key, but they got re-index based on what array was pass first as parameter.

![[Pasted image 20240309213401.png|center|500]]

In this case the both arrays have the same keys, however, the values are not override, but append and re-index.

![[Pasted image 20240309214041.png|center|500]]

### String keys
If one array has numeric keys, values are appended and keys are respected.

![[Pasted image 20240309214323.png|center|500]]

However, when a string key is repeated, the second repeated key is going to override the first one. 

![[Pasted image 20240309214353.png]]
## `array_reduce`
Reduce the array to single values using the callback function passed. The first argument is the array. The second is the callback, whose first argument is the return value of the previous iteration, and the second is the current iteration value.
### Without a initial value

On the first iteration, the first argument is nothing or null, but this can be customizable by passing a third argument which is the initial value. 

![[Pasted image 20240309215024.png|center|500]]

In this case, the first iteration happens, the first argument initial value is required (zero), then the expression is evaluated (0 + some result) and its result (something) is assigned to the first argument, the iteration ends. The second iteration happens, the first argument initial value is required (something), then the expression is evaluated (something + some result) and its result is assigned to the first argument, the iteration ends. 
### With an initial value

## `array_search`
Will return the key of the first matching value. First argument is the needled (the value to search), the second is the haystack (the array), the last argument is if want to use a loose or strict comparison. 

![[Pasted image 20240309215753.png|center|500]]

Detail there are two 'b', but they key of the first matching value is being returned. 

>Search is case sensitive. 
>![[Pasted image 20240309222827.png|center|500]]

>[!warning] Not finding a value vs a returned 0
False is return if a value is not found, but 0 if a value is found in the first position. Because of this, the strict comparison must be used when making comparison using the return value of the array search function. This is an example of the error.

## `in_array`
Check if a value is within an array returning true or false.

![[Pasted image 20240309223713.png|center|500]]
![[Pasted image 20240309223735.png|center|500]]


## `array_diff`
Compare the first array against of the given arrays, and return the values of the first array that are not present in any of the other arrays. 

Detail 3 is only on the second compared array, but is on one anyways, so the function don't return anything. 

![[Pasted image 20240309223909.png|center|500]]

>The function only check for values and not keys.

## `array_diff_assoc`
Check if the pair key/values are on the other arrays.

![[Pasted image 20240309224203.png|center|500]]

## `array_diff_key`
Check for the keys instead of the values but work the same as `array_diff`.

![[Pasted image 20240309224311.png|center|500]]


## Sorting
The next two values don't return a new array, instead they sort the same array. The actual return type of the functions is true. 

![[Pasted image 20240309225224.png|center|500]]
### `asort`
Sort array by values, based on different sorting flags. 

In this example, the default flag is being used.

![[Pasted image 20240309224400.png|center|500]]

### `ksort`
Sort by keys instead of the values. 

![[Pasted image 20240309224505.png|center|500]]


### `usort`
I can pass a customer callback to sort it whichever desire way. The call back has two values, and in this example, the [[22.8 Arithmetic operators#^e2f7a3|spaceship]] operator is being used; in this case the array is being sorted incrementally. 

![[Pasted image 20240309225852.png|center|500]]


>In this case, the array keys are remove, because usort use numeric keys to sort all values based on the given callback. 
>The values index are being affected by the return value of the callback. The callback is doing the same thing as having the cmp function. In this case, the key is moving 1 or -1 depending on the result of the comparison. 

![[Pasted image 20240309230147.png|center|200]]

Having the reverse spaceship (b <=> a) will sort in reverse order.

![[Pasted image 20240309230313.png|center|500]]


## `array_destruct`
To remove values of the array or break the array into separate variables, to be re assigned. This **won't modify** the array. To do this I can use a language construct `list` or its shorthand version [`$variables to assign`].

![[Pasted image 20240309230705.png|center]]


![[Pasted image 20240309230759.png|center|400]]

Array values can be skipped by leaving the space.

![[Pasted image 20240309230837.png|center|500]]

### Destruct hashes
An additional [] is required.

![[Pasted image 20240309231053.png|center|500]]

### Targeting using keys
This work as well with string keys.
