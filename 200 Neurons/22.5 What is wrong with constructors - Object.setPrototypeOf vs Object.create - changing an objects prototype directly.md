[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

- They look like regular JS functions, though they don't behave like that. 
- The [[22.5 Functions as Object and Constructors -  direct and indirect instances - instanceof|instanceof]] operator check the whole `[[Prototype]]` chain, which doesn't confirm if an object was made with an specific constructor, because `prototype` of CF can be reassigned after the creation of an object. 

Check the following example to know the problems with constructors. Factory Functions solve this problems. 

## Object.setPrototypeOf vs Object.create for inheritance
The following example shows the big difference between using `Object.setPrototypeOf()` and `Object.create()` to reassign the `prototype`. 

```js
// Define a constructor function
function Animal(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

// Create an instance of Animal
let dog = new Animal('Buddy');

// At this point, dog is an instance of Animal
console.log(dog instanceof Animal); // true

// Create another constructor
function Plant(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

// Create an instance of Plant
let tree = new Plant('Oak');

// At this point, tree is an instance of Plant, not Animal
console.log(tree instanceof Plant); // true
console.log(tree instanceof Animal); // false
```

Up to this point, the `prototype` of both CF are their respective constructor.


And the `[[Prototype]]` of each instance is the `prototype` property of their father objects, this is the constructor and the `[[Prototype]]: Object`.



### Using `Object.setPrototypeOf()`
```js
// Now, let's manipulate the prototype chain
Object.setPrototypeOf(Plant.prototype, Animal.prototype)
// Create a new Plant instance after changing the prototype
let flower = new Plant('Rose');

// After the prototype of Animal has been reassigned 
console.log(flower instanceof Plant); // true
console.log(flower instanceof Animal); // true (!)

// The Plant constructor is within the Plant CF, therefore tree is still a direct instance of Plant
console.log(tree instanceof Plant); // true

// We can even make dog an "instance" of Plant
Object.setPrototypeOf(dog, Plant.prototype);
console.log(dog instanceof Plant); // true 
console.log(dog instanceof Animal); // true
```

The `prototype` of the father object is chain (literally copied) one level down, becoming the `[[Prototype]]` of the child object. The `Plant` CF original `prototype` is only its constructor and the `Object.prototype` represented by the `[[Prototype]] Object`. 

Once is use `Object.setPrototypeOf()` the `Animal.prototype` (its constructor) is chained one level down via `[[Prototype]]`, thus, `Plant`  have the `Animal.prototype` (green) and its own `prototype`

Thus, the `instanceOf` operator checks if the  checks if the prototype property of the constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of the object. In this case, the `Animal.prototype`, the green square, is within the prototype chain of all objects, therefore, flower, dog and tree are instances  of both Plant and Animal.

This behavior can cause bugs because only dog is direct instance of Animal, and flower and tree are direct instances of Plant. However, the operator thinks all objects are instances of both Animal and Plant. 


### Using `Object.create()`
```js
// Now, let's manipulate the prototype chain
Plant.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Create a new Plant instance after changing the prototype
let flower = new Plant('Rose');

// Here's where it gets interesting
console.log(flower instanceof Plant); // true
console.log(flower instanceof Animal); // true (!)

// But our original tree is now disconnected from Plant and Animal
console.log(tree instanceof Plant); // false (!)
console.log(tree instanceof Animal); // false (!)
```

In this case, the child CF `prototype` is totally replaced by the father CF `prototype`. After making the prototype replacement, the `Plant.prototype` is **replaced** with the `Animal.prototype`. 

So, flower is an instance of Plant and Animal because, the `instanceOf` operator checks if the green box of Plant or Animal is in the chain, the `prototype` is within the chain of the objects, and that's true. A **major bug** appears here because tree is not longer an instance of neither Plant or Animal, because the `tree` `[[Prototype]]` doesn't look like neither the prototypes of Plant and Animal.
