## Navigation

>Using any value for the `justify-content` property.

>[!example]- Free space distributed within the items

>Use `flex: auto;` to share the same amount of free space among items.

>Use `flex: 1;` to make all flex item the same width, distributing differently the free space.

>Here using gap allow the remainder free space (not much) to be distributed to the left margin of the last item.

## Card layout pushing footer down
In normal layout, blocks stack below each other, so pushing a footer to the bottom is not possible. If a div has a specified with, this situation will look like this.

## Media objects
A media object is defined by the description and the image. Thus, its size is define by the image and its body (description). The image should be able to be flipped moving from left to right, commonly use for display images and descriptions. 

Adding a `max-width` property is useful to prevent the image growing to much.

Having the image within a div, when the div is the flex item and the image is just another HTML element could bring problems in terms of overflowing. 

>[!example]
>![[Pasted image 20240215130209.png]]
>In this case, both flex items are the same size, as they are using flex:1, the flex-basis is 0, thus, they have the same size. However, the image overflow the content. To solve this, a min-width should be applied to the image.

So, I think is better not to have the image within a container, but let the image be a flex item.

Also, changing the flex factor, for example, the image flex:3 and the content flex:1 can add emphasis on something. 


## Form controls
A common pattern is to have an input element paired with a button. This is useful wrapping the button and the input with a flex div.

Also, a label can easily be added.
