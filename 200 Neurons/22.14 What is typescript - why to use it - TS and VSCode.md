# About TS

TS is a JS supersede; all JS code is TS compatible. TS doesnâ€™t work in execution time, but in development; so all the TS code is transpiled to JS for the browser to work with (the browser didn't understand any TS code).

## TS compile to JS
>[!blank-container|float-left]

All the TS code, **even the errors**, disappears when the TS code is compiled to JS.

TS grants type checking and safety **only during development**

The image shows how TS only type check during development. The code is JS-syntaxis accurate, but lacks of TS checks. However, it gets compile, and therefore, executed in the browser. 

# Benefit of TS
- Static types: everything (functions, variables, return types, etc.) has a static type. JS don't provide any kind of type enforcement. 
- Organizational support: TS allows to group and modularize large amounts of code (in object-oriented like classes that supports inheritance, access modifiers, constructors, etc.), using namespaces, interfaces,  and modules. 
- Tooling: autocompletion, TS automatically generates source maps. 
- Code intention: TS grants to attach intention to the code, like the image below, anyone reading the determine function will have an idea of what that function does. 
- TS moves programming errors from runtime to compile time.

The highly JS dynamism makes it unpredictable when working with complex data, functions and variables. Types in JS don't exist directly. For example, function's return values and arguments have no type, therefore, the output could be wrong.
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```js
>function determine (a, b){
>    return a + b;
>}
>
>determine(3, 5); // 8
>determine(3, 'hi'); // "3hi"
>determine(true, 5);   // 6
>```



In this case, the return value and the arguments don't have a type definition, thus, when the function is invoked, its parameters and return could be of any type generating obvious problems. 


When the types are defined, any attempt to use a variable or value that don't comply with the type will trigger a syntax error in VScode.

>determine(true, 5);   // 6
>```

Here, TS already knows the types, thus, the two last calls show an error.

# TS within VSCode
These are some tips to use and understand how to use TS within VS code:

- VSCode is build with TS, is already 'installed'. Only install the pretty TS errors plugin. 
- When hover over any type of value, a pop-up appear indicating the value type. In the case off objects it will show the objects properties. 
- To check if the TS inference is working fine, I can use dot notation and see if the pop-up method/properties window is adequate. For example, using this with a string value have to show the string methods. 
- VSCode won't show all of the errors in red but with a underline like in [[22.14 Working with functions#^ece377|this]] example.
