[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

Rendering performance defines the INP (Interaction to Next Paint) metric measure. It involves several stages that must work together to make the rendering as fast and smooth as possible. 

## Pixels-to-screen pipeline
To know which CSS rules affect each stage, detail [this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20220727225220/https://csstriggers.com/) about the CSS triggers. Each stage can introduce jank animations

### JS
Stage involve when render change is initiate by any JS action/method/function. However, there are other ways to trigger rendering changes like: transitions, animations or any other [web animation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API). 
### Style (or recalculate)
Stage that is almost always involve. The browser recalculate the compute CSS rules to apply to every element. Typically occurs when the page first load, when add/removing DOM elements, changing any CSS or any CSS pseudo-class. To optimize: use simpler selectors and rules, avoid overrides and use BEM or CSS modules methodologies. 
### Layout (or reflow)
Stage where the browser calculates the exact position and size of each element on a page, including width, height and relative position to other elements. It typically occurs when the page first loads, after DOM or any CSS changes, or when the window resize. Bad performance in this stage can trigger layout trashing.
### Paint 
Process when the browser fills in the pixels of each element, it draw the elements. It happens after the layout stage, any change in a visual property and when scrolling. To optimize, try to keep elements in the same layer (having a constant z-axis distance value), reduce paint areas or use clipping regions (using the `clip-path` property).
### Composite
Is the final step **before** the content is displayed on the screen. This stage combine all layers handling overlapping, transparency and transformations. It happens with certain CSS properties and after scrolling.
