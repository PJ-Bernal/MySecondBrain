[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

Promises can be used with async or sync procedures. Generally, the executor has an async behavior, but I can use sync code to call immediately either resolve or reject.

```js
let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // not taking our time to do the job
  resolve(123); // immediately give the result: 123
});
```

However, in some cases, I don't know if a function will be async or sync, for example when retrieving some user information, in which I can have the data cached, or I need to perform an async fetch operation.

In this cases, my high-end function should always return a promise to handle both, async and sync, scenarios. 

In this example the `getUserDetail()` function always return a promise. `Promise.resolve()` creates a new Promise that is immediately resolved with the given value.

```js
let userCache = {};

function getUserDetail(username) {
  // In both cases, cached or not, a promise will be returned

  if (userCache[username]) {
      // Return a promise without the "new" keyword
    return Promise.resolve(userCache[username]);
  }

  // Use the fetch API to get the information
  // fetch returns a promise
  return fetch('users/' + username + '.json')
    .then(function(result) {
      userCache[username] = result;
      return result;
    })
    .catch(function() {
      throw new Error('Could not find user: ' + username);
    });
}
```

## Promise.resolve() vs new Promise()
`Promise.resolve()` is a shorthand for creating a new Promise that is immediately resolved.
It's equivalent to: `new Promise((resolve) => resolve(userCache[username]))`. 

I can also do `Promise.reject`.
