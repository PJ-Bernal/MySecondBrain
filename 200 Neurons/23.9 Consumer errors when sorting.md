Sorting is invalid when they ask a property for which no key in the dictionary exists. 

Create a method on the property mapping service.

Add it to the interface

Use it in the controller. First use constructor injection.

Then in the get authors method use that method, so if no valid mapping exists, return bad request.

Instead of 500, detail the 400.

That piece of code is reusable for other resource collections.
