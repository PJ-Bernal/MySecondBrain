# About public fields - 'bad' practice
The access modifiers of the field members are `public`, meaning the object fields can be read can be read and change, using the object. (I can read an change the fields from 'outside' of the class). 

```c#
public class Employee
{
  public string firstName;
  public int age;
  
  public Employee(string name, int ageValue)
  { 
    firstName = name;
    age = ageValue;
  }
}

Employee employee1 = new Employee();
employee1.firstName = "Ana"; 
```

# Private fields, setters and getters - applying encapsulation
Again, this is bad design based on [[23.1 Encapsulation and data hiding#^eb2dbc|this]]. Is better to make fields private, and create a setter and getter method to follow the encapsulation principles. 

```c#
public class Employee
{
  private string firstName;
  private int age;

  public int GetAge()
  {
    return age;
  }

  public void SetAge(int newAge)
  {
    age = newAge; 
  }
  
  public Employee(string name, int ageValue)
  { 
    firstName = name;
    age = ageValue;
  }
}
```

# About properties
>[!important] About backend fields
> A private field that stores the data exposed by a public property is called a backing store or backing field.

Having multiple fields and creating a setter and getter for each one is verbose. Thus, C# offers properties to enforce encapsulation. No need for semicolon for the property.

Properties are class members that wraps **private** fields creating a public/private interface using accessor methods (getter, and setter) with the same name of the property. This fields are backing fields, and its name start with `_`.

By default, properties contain a get and set, but is not require to have both. They are public by default, but can be set to private. 

Properties expose data, but hide the implementation. 

Detail `_age` is still a field, but `Age` is a property, thus, to use the accessor methods use the upper case property with dot notation. 

`value` is a new keyword that allow the setter's object to recognize when the object is setting a value, thus, the passed expression when using the setter is assigned to `value` and send to the setter implementation. 

>[!important]
>- Not all member fields must have property members. If the field is private and is used only within the class implementation, a property is not required. 
>- However, is also useful to have all fields mapped to properties and use properties instead of fields within the class implementation. 
## Auto-implemented properties
Backing fields are not required by using auto-implemented properties where the compiler automatically creates a backing field. However, the accessor methods can't have any kind of implementation, if needed, then a backing field is required. 

```c#
public class Person
{
  public string Name {get; private set;}
}
```

This properties are useful for fields the class needs to modify and protect; both without any kind of verification. 
## Using the properties implementation, the accessor methods 
Nothing different, just use dot notation. Set or get a field, will trigger automatically the property accessor methods (using the upper case property).

Detail the second and third line are not calling directly the field, but the property! Be mindful specially for the third one, the code is not accessing the field directly with `employee.FirstName`, but invoking behind the hood the getter. 

```c#
Employee employee = new Employee();
employee.FirstName = "Ana"; // This triggers the setter
int empFirstName = employee.FirstName; // This triggers the getter
```

>[!important] Really important
>Once a field is wrapped in a property, the rest of the class implementation, though is not required, should use the properties (either accessor methods).

### Using properties in the constructor
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20250108094723.png|450]]

Within the constructor is not possible to use an instance, therefore, using the property directly will trigger the setter accessor method. 


## Private accessor methods
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20250108094229.png|300]]

Though accessor methods provide an interface to interact with the object, sometimes either method should be private, thus, the property accessor method will be accessible from within the class. 

Is not a good option to delete either of the methods.

Doing `bethany.Wage = 100;` will trigger an error. 

## Backing fields
Properties wraps fields, however,
