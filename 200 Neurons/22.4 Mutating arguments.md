[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

When a method is called and objects are passed as arguments, the local variables of the method act as pointers to the designated objects. In this example, detail how the number holds the same object id even inside the method. But the string, as soon as the shovel operand, it alter the object, so the object **is the same**.

>[!important] However
>If the method use a method that mutate the object, it can mutate the arguments passed onto, regardless `a` is outside the method definition's scope. 

```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3]

# Example of a method definition that mutates its argument permanently
def mutate(array)
  array.pop
end

mutate(a)
```

Be mindful this is different if I decide to assign the variable to a local method variable and then work with it. In this example method gets reassigned to 7, but a remains the same. 

```ruby
def some_method(number)
  number = 7 # this is implicitly returned by the method
end

a = 5
some_method(a)
puts a #=> 5
```
