# TS custom types
TS add some custom types on the top of JS's primitive types:
- Enums: allow to give names to a finite set of numeric values.
- Void: represents absence of a type. Common for functions. 
- Never: assign to values that never occur. 
- Any: use TS inference mechanism to infer the type of the variable, hence the variable can be initialized with any value type. Useful when working with libraries that return several types back.
