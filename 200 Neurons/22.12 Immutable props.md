[[12.12 React|React]]

Props should be immutable, once I pass a prop (an argument to the component function) to the component (when being invoked in app), ss a bad practice to change the argument within the component. 

This image is showing a change in the value of the user name prop.

If I need to do some testing or something else, just create a const within the component and try, but never change the value of a given prop.
