# While in break point
Remember, when the application is in break mode, it stops, so I can add break points, step over or into, inspect variables, etc. Once done Y can click on continue. In this moment, the continue green button is usable. 

In break point I can hove over the variables to see its value and type, with the tool tip called data tip. 
## Placing a breakpoint
When placing a breakpoint, as soon as the control flow, the yellow arrow, reach the line, the application will go again into break mode, the app stops there. 
## Debug an already passed code
If I step over a method I want to step into, click and drag the yellow arrow to the desire place. Doing this, only moves the yellow arrow, it doesn't change the current values of the context; so if I change a value, and then move the arrow, an old value will be there. 

>Also, if I step step into with F10, the code will run twice!!!! Move the yellow arrow and then step over will execute all statements encoutered again.
