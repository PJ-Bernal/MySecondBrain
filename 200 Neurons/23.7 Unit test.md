# About units test
Testing is the process of:
- Detecting bugs during development. 
- Test if a new implementation break the functionality of a method.
- Serve as documentation to showcase how the objects are meant to be use. 

Unit tests can test methods, constructors, properties, anything. 

Unit test, tests small isolated portions (class methods) of the code. There are several techniques to do that, for example, writing mocks. 

>[!important]+ What's isolated code
Real-world methods will invoke other methods, that invoke other methods, etc. Unit test allow to test just the 'upper' or selected method, and not all other parts it invokes.
