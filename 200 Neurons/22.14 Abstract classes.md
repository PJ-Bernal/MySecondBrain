[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

They must be used as base classes and not to create instances, they are like interfaces, but they may contain implementation details.

I can define abstract methods without implementations, they must be implemented in derived classes.

Then add an abstract method. So, any child class must provide an implementation, it own implementation, to that method.

 Now see the child class must implement the print credits abstracat method of the father.

Abstract classes can't create instances.
