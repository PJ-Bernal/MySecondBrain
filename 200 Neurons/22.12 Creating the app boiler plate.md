[[12.12 React|React]]

## Directory structure and root

After that, the project will have the following default directories. Inside the HTML, is a `<div id="root">` this is the root mention in previous notes, and a script that is loading a main module in the src directory. 

Remember, within src is where all the code file should be. 


Once Vite has been used. One of the main files is `main.jsx` within `src` directory. This file is the **starting point** of the application.

## Creating the app

In the lastest version of react, the first two lines are quite similar of making the first two imports in [[22.12 Using react without dependencies|here]]. 

The las import, is importing the styles (because Vite import and bundle the css).


Then, the first code line grabs the Node DOM element where I want to create my app, in this case, the root element. The above line exactly the same as seen in the plain react examples:

```jsx
const root = ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
)
```

>[!info]
>The above code doesn't work because the latest version of React import `createRoot` instead of `ReactDOM`. Doing this is a shorter way, but is the same.

Remember `render()` will render the element, so:

```jsx
import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx'
import './index.css'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  'hola mundo'
)
```
