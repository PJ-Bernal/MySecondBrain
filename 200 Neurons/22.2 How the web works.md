[[12.2 The internet]]
## Clients and servers
Computers connected to the internet are called **clients** and **servers**. A simplified diagram of their interaction look like this.
![[Pasted image 20231017200530 1.png|center|270]]
- Clients: web users internet-connected devices (pc, phone, etc.) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser). Web browsers are responsible for issuing HTTP request and process the HTTP response in a user-friendly manner. 
- Servers: computers that store webpages, sites or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the machine to be displayed on the user's web browser. 
## The other components
Imagine the client is my apartment and the server is a shop I want to buy something from. In between those two are all of these:

>[!tip]- Internet connection
>- Allows to send and receive data on the web.

>[!tip]- TCP/IP
>- Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet; in the example could like a bike or car. 

>[!tip]- DNS 
>- Domain Name System, name the browser uses to find a website IP address before it can retrieve the website. The browser need to find out which server the website lines on so it can send HTTP messages to the right place. Like looking for the shop address.

>[!tip]- HTTP 
>- Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. Like the language I use to order my goods.

>[!tip]- Component files 
>- Parts that made the website, they are two main types:
>	- Code files: HTML, CSS, JS, etc.
>	- Assets: all other stuff that makes a website lie images, video, pdfs, etc. 
## What happened exactly?
When I type a web address into the browser:
1. The browser goes to the DNS server and find the real address of the servers the website lives on.
2. The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking to send a copy of the website to the client. This and all messages are send across the internet connection using TCP/IP.
3. If the server approves the client's request, the server send a message to the client granted permission to see the website and start sending the website's files to the browser in small chunks called data packets. 
4. The browser assembles the chunks into a complete website and displays it. 
## Order in which component files are parsed
1. The browser parses the HTML first recognizing the link tag that references external CSS stylesheet and any scripts.
2. Then sends requests back to the server for any CSS and JS files it has found from link and scripts tag. Then parses those two.
3. The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML and generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS and compiles and executes the parsed JS.
4. As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from the CSSOM tree and executes the JS, a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen.
