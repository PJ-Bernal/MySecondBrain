# Start the debugger
## F10, F5 or green arrow
To start debugging press F5, or hit the green arrow. When working with a project for the first time and is uncertain what's the entry point of the app, press F10, and that will open the editor on the first line of the app.

In this example, program.cs was open so that's the entry point. In this moment, VS is in debugging mode, check the red pause button.

>When the application is running, the continue button is gray. Only when the app is debugging, the button is usable.

While in break mode, using the debugging tools, I can inspect a method when its highlighted using the step into. Detail at this moment, a yellow arrow will shows only in break mode and is the line of code the application is 'breaking' right now. 

## Run to cursor, Ctrl + F10
Starts the debugging in an specific line, just right click on any line code. That will start the app, and then open the debugging mode placing the break arrow where I place the cursor.

# Basic debugging tools

Skip that invocation of a method and will move to the next statement. 




## Step into F11
In this example, clicking the step into will take me to the method implementation.

Then I can step into the method, if the method use another method within.

## Step out Shift + F11
Step out of the current statement/method.
