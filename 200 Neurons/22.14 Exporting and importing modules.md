# Exporting a declaration
The API expose by a module is defined by the items that are exported from it. If the API implementation have 10 methods, I can export a single method, and that will be the API for other modules to use.

In this example, the module is exporting an interface named Person. A module can export properties, classes, functions, objects, etc.

Anything without the `export` keyword can't be used for other modules as it won't be exported. 
## Default exports
If the importing module don't specify what it want to import from the module, it will import the `default`.

## Export statements
This allows to bundle all the things I want to export, instead of adding `export` for each one of them. Export statements can't use the `default` keyword, but they use the `as` keyword, hence, in the other  modules the Employee class for example will appear as `StaffMember` instead, so in the module I import, I have to import with the name `StaffMember`.

# Import from a module
When importing, the module can import only what it requires. 
## Select import

## Default imports
Not curly braces, the default export will be imported. Detail the default export `Employee` will be assign with the given name in the import statement, `Worker` in this case. This allow to give what I import, a name that is related to the module I'm making the imports from.
