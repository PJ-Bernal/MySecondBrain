This reset use the modern-normalize reset and some extra features [I can check here](https://mattbrictson.com/blog/css-normalize-and-reset#improved-line-height). The snippets were taken from [matt brictson](https://mattbrictson.com/blog/css-normalize-and-reset). Also remember some of this snippets are explained [[22.7 Analyzing the reset properties of Josh Comeau|here]]. [Here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize/blob/main/modern-normalize.css) is the normalization code. 

```css
@import "modern-normalize";

:root {
  line-height: 1.5;
  /*Test this one. Taken from Josh Comeau
  line-height: calc(1em + 0.5rem);
  */
  /*line-height: calc(1ex / 0.32);
  This one is from: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/css-techniques-legibility/ */
}



h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, figure, p, ol, ul {
  margin: 0;
}

ol[role="list"], ul[role="list"] {
  list-style: none;
  padding-inline: 0;
}

p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-size: inherit;
  font-weight: inherit;
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
}

/*From Josh*/
input, button, textarea, select {
  font: inherit;
}

/*From Josh*/
img, picture, video, canvas, svg {
  display: block;
  max-width: 100%;
}

/*Taken from Josh Comeau*/
body{
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}

/* Read the Josh explanation about this one
#root, #__next {
  isolation: isolate;
}
*/
```

>[!important] For Tailwind
>It ships with a preflight that is a combination of a normalize and reset stylesheet, so I won't have to do anything.
