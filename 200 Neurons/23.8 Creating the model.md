# Creating the model
## Adding POCO classes
One of the model classes is the Pie class.

The image shows POCO classes. In this example, the Pie is a class part of the domain of the application. 

The nullable operator is null to indicate some properties could be null. 

If something shouldn't be null, then assign it a default value like in name.

At the end, use the default!, the [[23.7 Null forgiving operator|null forgiving operator]].
The files don't have any usings because the csproj file has implicit usings enabled, so classes are using global usings.
