Detail this controller has business logic within it, this is not bad, is just another approach; I could have that logic inside of a service layer.

# Controller types
## Thick or fat
Controller that contains logic that implements an expected behavior. This behavior is what should be unit tested. This behavior could be checking the model state, make calls to the db via EFC, it may contain code that returns different objects, etc.

## Thin or skinny
The controllers only contains actions that delegate the actual implementation of the behavior to other components. This controllers doesn't need to be unit tested.

# About testing controllers
Unit testing a controller's actions means unit testing the controller behavior, meaning, the unit test should avoid model binding, filters, routing, etc. Testing that with the controller itself is in reality an integration test. 

Again, this doesn't mean the things I try to isolate the test from don't have to be tested. Meaning, a custom middleware or action filters need to be tested. 
## What behavior to test?
- Test whether the correct type of result is return from an specific action. For example, testing if the controller is returning a generic action result or an `ActionResult<T>`, a bad request, etc.
- Test the type of the return data. Test if the model return a dto model, or a list of errors if the validation fails, etc. 
- Test the values of the return data. 
- Any other thing a controller action can do.

The idea is to test the controller behavior.
