[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

Call Stack is a JS engine mechanism to keep track of the function calls and manage execution contexts (global and function EC).  It has the information on what function is currently being run and what functions are invoked from within that function.

>[!important] It works based on the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle
>- When you execute a script, the JavaScript engine creates a global execution context and pushes it on top of the call stack.
>- Whenever a function is called, the JavaScript engine creates a function execution context for the function, pushes it on top of the call stack, and starts executing the function.
>- If a function calls another function, the JavaScript engine creates a new function execution context for the function being called and pushes it on top of the call stack.
>- When the current function completes, the JavaScript engine pops it off the call stack and resumes the execution where it left off.
>- The script will stop when the call stack is empty.
## How the call stack works
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function average(a, b) {
    return add(a, b) / 2;
}

let x = average(10, 20);
```

This is how the call stack of this script works:

When the JavaScript engine executes this script, it places the global execution context (denoted by main() or global() function on the call stack. Then it creates the average function execution context, push it to the top of the stack, and executing it. 

Then the JS engine creates another function execution context for the `add()` function, executes and then poops it off of the stack. Then average can be executed, pops it off. Then the stack is empty and the script stops executing. 
## Stack overflow
The call stack has a fixed size, depending on the implementation of the host environment, either the web browser or Node.js. If the number of execution contexts exceeds the size of the stack, a stack overflow error will occur.

## Asynchronous JS
JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. This means that the JavaScript engine has only one call stack. Therefore, it only can do one thing at a time.

When executing a script, the JavaScript engine executes code from top to bottom, line by line. In other words, it is synchronous.

Asynchronous means the JavaScript engine can execute other tasks while waiting for another task to be completed. For example, the JavaScript engine can:

- Request for data from a remote server.
- Display a spinner
- When the data is available, display it on the webpage.

To do this, the JavaScript engine uses an event loop, which will be covered in the following tutorial.
