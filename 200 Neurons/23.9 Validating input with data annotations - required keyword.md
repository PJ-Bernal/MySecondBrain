Detail the 400.

The og code shows the title is required, but the description could be null, however, the response body indicates both are required, which is incorrect.

Now, in the course for creating dto, there are no validations, so the error messages are not coming from here.

In this other request, detail the description is not null but empty and the return code is 201, this is not correct.

# Why this happens
EFC doesn't trigger validation on save, how this is manage depends on the db provider, in this case, sqlite which lets the update go through. Instead, when using sql server, it will check the would have check for the max length on title for example.

>Because validation rules change according to the db provider, those validation rules must be apply before the request hit the db.

# Defining the rules
To see what ASP offer for validation write `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.`

The rules defined in the DTOs should be the same, or have the same behavior, as the ones in the class entities.

Also, remember I can use `set` or `init` for the properties.

## Using the required keyword
Is another approach but this is a native c# keyword that works during compile time. The attributes work during runtime.

Now, detail the 400 is generated, because the title was to long.

## About nullable types and data annotations
Nullable reference types are a compile-time feature that helps you write safer code by preventing null assignments where they shouldn't occur. 

Data annotation validation rules are a runtime feature that ensures the data your API receives is valid according to your business rules. Meaning, for validation use data annotations and not nullable reference types.
