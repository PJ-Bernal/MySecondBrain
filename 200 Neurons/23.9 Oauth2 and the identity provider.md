# About OAuth2
Using tokens for securing APIs is not efficient specially when the application needs to interact with several APIs, in which each should check, for example, the username and password, and each API returns its own token. So the app need to handle multiple tokens at once.

OAuth2 tokens use a third party called the Identity Provider that created the token. 

It can be seen as a special kind of API that's added to the app landscape, to hand out tokens to the apps that need a token. 

The token use for APIs is called access token, and the front-end use an identity token. 
## How to obtain a token
The Client Credential Flow is used to obtain the token from the Identity Provider, to do machine-to-machine authentication, no user is involved. In OAuth terms, the app that wants the token is called client, and could be any kind of app, mobile, console, etc. 

To obtain the token, the client send a Client ID and a Secret, those credentials have **nothing** to do with the user of the API, they are used to authenticate the **client** (the app that is going to consume the API).

Then, the provider send an access token to the client, token that will be send along with each request to the API. Finally the API verify the token.

Detail there are in reality at least three applications when implementing OAuth tokens: the API, the web app and the provider. 
### Access tokens advantages
- Access tokens are store in the client, so there's no need to make a request to the provider for each request the client does to the API.
- They have a limited lifetime controlled by the provider. Once the time is up, a new token is required, 
- Multiple APIs can be supported with a single access token.
