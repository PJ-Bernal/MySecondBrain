# About records
Records are reference/value types that could be use instead of a class, is smaller than a class, and it can be a class or a struct. Records are recommended when the custom type will have only data, though they can contain methods. 

By default, record creates a class-based which is a reference type.
## Advantages of using records
Records have built-in functionality created automatically, like the following.
### Immutability
Blocking any changes to the data wrapped in an object; classes don't have this built-in functionality.

When a positional record is created, the object definition is immutable. Thus, the object definition is read only. 

### Value-based equality
When an object class is instantiated with, for example, fields members. Regardless if two objects have the exact same type and value within it object definition, they are two separate objects, therefore, they are not equal.

Positional records use value-based equality. This means, based on the diagram above, again, the code has two separate objects, two separate references. However, they are equal!!!! This not happen with classes, only with positional records.

The equality happens if the records have the same members, and its values are the same.

# Creating a record
## Creating a record class - reference type
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```c#
>public record Account;
>public record class Account

Records are classes, therefore, those two lines server exactly the same purpose, create a record. The only difference is semantics, for example, if the code base will have a `record struct` is better to use `record class` to make code more readable. 

## Creating a record struc - value type
Use `public record struct Account;` won't create a class, but a value type, because structs are value types. 
## Creating records with a constructor - positional record
To create a record with a constructor, add the constructor next to the record definition. This creates a positional record whose instances, the object body, will be to read only. 

For this kind of records, it'll be required to pass the parameters when instantiating an object based on this record. 

```c#
public record Account(string AccountNumber);
```

# Instantiated a record
Use `new` as usual: `Account newAccount = new("123");`. This instantiated is based on the above code, and since its a positional record, the argument is required. 

# If a class has data only, use a positional record 
Detail the whole class implementation, from lines 7 to 19, is avoided creating a single positional record.

In the program, once a value is set, it canÂ¿ be change.![[Pasted image 20250107101049.png]]
