This note test is about testing the behavior of the Full name property, of the employee base class; However, this is an abstract class, therefore it can't generate instances.

>For testing abstract classes is better to use mocking, but for now, using a derived class is enough.

# Creating the test
Create a new class for the test. (FullNameIsConcetenated).

Detail the derived class is being used, this is because the arrange needs to be as agnostic of other code as possible. The code base use a factory class to create instance, however, that's not a good idea because the test now "depends" on something else, and it could fail on something the test is not actually testing.

>[!important]
>All methods, equal, starts with, etc. Have a 'negavite' version, like NotEqual, DoesNotContain, etc.
