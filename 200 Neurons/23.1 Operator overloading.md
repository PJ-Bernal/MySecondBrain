Operator overloading allows you to change the meaning of an operator (+ could be overloaded and be change to -). Java don't allow operator overloading. 

In context of String, the plus sign represents string concatenation.
```Java
String firstName = "joe", lastName = "smith";
String Name = firstName + " " + lastName; //Output: joe smith
```
