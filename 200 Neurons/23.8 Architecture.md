# Core ASP.NET Core platform 
Contains the more low-level features. This includes the code that receive the request and create the responses, but middleware, the integrated kestrel server and more.  

# Application frameworks
On top of the Core platform, are the application frameworks. Most of the code written will use those frameworks, rather than the Core ASP.NET Core platform. However, I canâ€™t use any application platform without using the ASP.NET Core platform. 

Concepts are shared between frameworks, thus, learning one or another is simple. 

## MVC
The most used app framework used to create server-side render apps. Its in fact a design pattern. Used for larger apps. 
## Razor pages
Newer framework introduced to go around the complexity sometimes derived when using MVC. Razor is also sever side rendering. Razor are simpler to create and implemented for simpler apps. 
## Minimal APIs
Framework that works closely with MVC, to create API in a very conscice way. 
# Other frameworks
-	Entity framework: to interact with databases.
-	Identity: log in features. 
-	gRPC: high performance RPC services.
