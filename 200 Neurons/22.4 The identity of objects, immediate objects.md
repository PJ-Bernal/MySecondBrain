>[!important]
>Two objects that have equivalent value can yet be two different objects in physical space (i.e. computer memory).

Here, the comparison check if the two objects are equivalent, and obviously, they are. However, using the `object_id` method, they have different and unique ids, so they are two different and independent objects. 

```ruby
x = "hello"
y = "hello"

# test x and y using the equality operator
x == y
#=> true

puts x.object_id   #=> 2100050200
puts y.object_id   #=> 2100060720
```

>[!warning] Immediate objects
>The objects that are cached and reused for certain values are referred to as "immediate" objects. These immediate objects include small integers, as well as some other immutable objects such as nil, true, and false.

```ruby
x = 42
y = 42

puts x.object_id == y.object_id
#=> true 
```
