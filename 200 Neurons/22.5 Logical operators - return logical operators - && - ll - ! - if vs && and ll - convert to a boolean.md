[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

Logical operators can be used with any datatype, and their result can also be of any data type, not only a boolean.

>[!important]  Handy for testing multiple conditions without writing nested if...else statements.
>To make code more clean and readable, remember comparisons return a boolean, so when using any comparison with array methods like [[22.5 The filter method|filter]], [[22.5 The map method|map]], etc. I can make a return statement with a comparison, instead of always use an if statement. 

Examples with filter and map array methods. 
```JS
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Instead of this
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => {
  if (number % 2 === 0) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
});

// Do this
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4]

```

## ||
The `||` (or) logical operator is meant to manipulate boolean operands. If **any** of its operands are `true`, it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.

>For the evaluation, all operands are converted to boolean.

>[!example]
>```javascript
if (1 || 0) { // works just like if( true || false )
  alert( 'truthy!' );
}
>// Output: 'truthy'
>```
>
>```javascript
let hour = 12;
let isWeekend = true;
>
// Here, all of the operands are booleans
if (hour < 10 || hour > 18 || isWeekend) {
  alert( 'The office is closed.' ); // it is the weekend
}
### When operands are not booleans
In this case, `||` finds the first truthy value based on the following conditions:

1. JS evaluates from left to right.
2. When the logical operator find a true, stops and return the original value of that operand.
3. If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were `false`), returns the last operand.

>[!example]
>Detail each operand is a value not a comparison (a > 1).
>```javascript
alert( null || 1 ); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value)
alert( null || 0 || 1 ); // 1 (the first truthy value)
alert( undefined || null || 0 ); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)

### Use cases
>[!example] Getting the first truthy value from a list of variables or expressions
>Return the first variable with a value in it; if all variables are empty, returns `Empty`
>```javascript
let firstName = "";
let lastName = "";
let nickName = "SuperCoder";
alert( firstName || lastName || nickName || "Empty"); // SuperCoder

>[!example] Getting the first truthy value from a list of variables or expressions
>Useful to control the execution of an expression with a side effect, such as a variable assignment or a function call. In the example the first line stops the evaluation immediately upon seeing `true` so `alert("not printed")` isn't run; this is so important because this could be a function call.
>```javascript
true || alert("not printed");
false || alert("printed");
>//Output: printed
>```
>This is extremely important because the `alert("not printed")` code is **never executed!**
>
>Sometimes, people use this feature to execute commands only if the condition on the left part is falelsy.

### Bad practice
Never try to list a values to check with OR like this. This expression always be true as any other non-zero values returns true (is like saying, is x equals to five, or seven or 10 or twenty). 

```javascript
if (x === 5 || 7 || 10 || 20) {
  // run my code }
```

The proper way is:

```javascript
if (x === 5 || x === 7 || x === 10 || x === 20) {
  // run my code }
```
## &&
Returns true if **all** operands are truthy and false otherwise. As with `||` operands can be of any data type. 
### When operands are not booleans
`&&` finds the first false value, based on the following criteria: 


1. JS evaluates from left to right.
2. When the logical operator find a false, stops and return the original value of that operand.
3. If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were `true`), returns the last operand.

>[!example]
>```javascript
alert( null && 5 ); // null
alert( 0 && "no matter what" ); // 0
alert( 1 && 2 && null && 3 ); // null
alert( 1 && 2 && 3 ); // 3, the last one
## || and && precedence
&& has more precedence than || so && is resolve first. This means && expressions can be imagine with a parenthesis.

>[!example]
>So the code `a && b || c && d` is essentially the same as if the `&&` expressions were in parentheses: `(a && b) || (c && d)`.
## Don't replace if with `||` or `&&`
Is a bad practice to use `||` or `&&` as a shorter way to write if. When using if, only if the argument is true, the code block is executed. However, with the `||` or `&&`, the code could be executed no matter if the argument is true or not.

>[!example]
>In this example, detail the use of || the comparison is true, but the alert is never executed. 
>```javascript
>let x = 1;
>(x > 0) && alert( 'Greater than zero!' ); // Greatier than zero
>(x > 0) || alert( 'Greater than zero!' ); // true
>
>// Do this instead
>if (x > 0) alert( 'Greater than zero!' );// Greatier than zero
## ! (Not)
>[!multi-column]
>
>This operator accepts a single value that is converted to boolean and returns the inverse value. Remember the [[22.5 Data types - objects or data types -  primitives as objects - autoboxing#^cca767|truthy and falsely values]].
>
>```javascript
alert( !true ); // false
alert( !0 ); // true

>[!tip]
>! has the highest precedence of all logical operators, so it always executes first. 
## Converting a value to a boolean type
There are two ways:
1. `!!`, the first `!` convert to a boolean and invert the value, the second `|` inverses it again. 
2. Use the `Boolean` function.

>[!example]
>```javascript
alert( !!"non-empty string" ); // true
alert( !!null ); // false
>alert( Boolean("non-empty string") ); // true
alert( Boolean(null) ); // false
