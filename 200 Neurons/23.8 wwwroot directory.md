# wwwroot directory

Refered to as the web root directory, contains all static code (don’t contain app server-side code), like images, css, JS. It contains files that are requested, downloaded to the client and used by the browser. 

Files in that folder are accessible using a relative path from this directory. For example, if inside the directory is an image, meaning, wwwroot/image1.jpg, then, the image is reachable via `bethanyspieshop.com/image1.jpg`. This is extremely important because the root of the site points to the root of the wwwroot directory. 

This directory is the only place where static files should be stored. Any static file place outside of the directory won’t be accessible, because ASP.NET Core by convention look that directory when requesting a static file. 

>[!important]
>The code inside the directory wont be arechable for the rest of the app, so C# must not be there.
