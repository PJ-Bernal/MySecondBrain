# About interfaces
Interfaces are another way to name a type. They don't use the = when being defined. Interfaces don't have any implementation, they define the structure of methods and properties a class or object **must** implement. 

Interfaces can't model every possible type TS can create, I can't se union types.  Detail interfaces define a single object `{}`, not a union type like `{} | number`

```ts
interface Amount2 {
    currency: string
    value: number
}
```

## Extends
Extends allows to extend types from an interface to another, interface or class. 

Extends "embeds" what the type/class has into that type/class. In this example, the type Hamster has "within it" the is alive, get fur or hair color, and squeak functions.

## Implements
Implements enforce the class to have an implementation of the function or fields on the class. Implements is only possible between an interface and a class, and the can implement only interfaces. 

Interfaces don't have any implementation, so it doesn't make sense to implements from an interfaces to an interface. 

Interfaces don't allow a class to directly implement a union type, the interface must represent an object. 

In this example, dog is not implementing the eat function.

So it must implement the function, creating an implementation within it.

However, I can implement classes, and this requires the class to have an implementation of the method of the class, which must match the type of the function implemented in the class I use to implement, in this case, the living organism.

under the hood, TS is seeing the class as an interface, is seeing the class like this: 

```ts
interface LivingOrganism {
  isAlive(): boolean
}
```

# In combination
A class can have a single extend, but multiple interfaces.
