[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

Type queries allow to extract a type from a value in different ways. 
# About keyof
Allows to obtain the type representing all property/methods keys of a instance. This doesn't work over objects. 

Detail the use of the intersection type, to obtain only the keys that are strings. In this example, the first type hold all key properties/methods of an instance of type Date.

There's only a single symbol.

# using keyof and type of
Keyof returns the keys for once I have a type. 

```ts
const contact = {
    name: 'pablo',
    age: '31'
}

// Here contact is a valud, not a type, so I can't use keyof
type test11 = keyof contact // error
```
