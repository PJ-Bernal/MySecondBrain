## Nested routes and outlets
Nested routes render a specific section of a webpage differently, adding any route as the children of another route when creating the object in the router of main.

```jsx
// main.tsx

import { StrictMode } from "react"
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";
import Profile from "./Profile";
import Spinach from "./Spinach";
import Popeye from "./Popeye";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <App />,
  },
  {
    path: "profile",
    element: <Profile />,
    children: [
      { path: "spinach", element: <Spinach /> },
      { path: "popeye", element: <Popeye /> },
    ],
  },
]);

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </StrictMode>,
);
```

The nested router are normal components, however, the 'father' router of the nested, in this case profile, must have an `Outlet` component that gets replaced with the children component when its path is visited. 

To have more control, put the outlet inside of a div. 

```jsx
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

const Profile = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello from profile page!</h1>
      <p>So, how are you?</p>
      <hr />
      <h2>The profile visited is here:</h2>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Profile;
```

## The default component
To render something as a default component when no path is added to the parent component, add an index route to the children.

This component will render if no route is selected. 

```jsx
const DefaultProfile = () => {
  return <p>Oh, nothing to see here!</p>;
};

export default DefaultProfile;
```

```jsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";
import Profile from "./Profile";
import DefaultProfile from "./DefaultProfile";
import Spinach from "./Spinach";
import Popeye from "./Popeye";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <App />,
  },
  {
    path: "profile",
    element: <Profile />,
    children: [
      { index: true, element: <DefaultProfile /> }, //here is the index
      { path: "spinach", element: <Spinach /> },
      { path: "popeye", element: <Popeye /> },
    ],
  },
]);

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </StrictMode>,
);
```

In this example, visiting profile will render the default component content. 

## Dynamic segments
The above work for rendering static URLs, meaning, when the URL doesn't change (always `/about` or `/home` and never `/profile/pablo` or `ana`). In the case the URLs change, for example, based on a user profile name, use dynamic segments like `/contacts/pablo` or `contacts/ana` 

To convert the path into a dynamic section add `:/` followed by the URL params that has a particular value, any value. This params require the `useParams` hook inside of the parent component.

```jsx
//main.jsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";
import Profile from "./Profile";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <App />,
  },
  {
    path: "profile/:name",
    element: <Profile />,
  },
]);

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </StrictMode>,
);

```

```jsx
//profile.jsx
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
import DefaultProfile from "./DefaultProfile";
import Spinach from "./Spinach";
import Popeye from "./Popeye";

const Profile = () => {
  const { name } = useParams();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello from profile page!</h1>
      <p>So, how are you?</p>
      <hr />
      <h2>The profile visited is here:</h2>
      {name === "popeye" ? (
        <Popeye />
      ) : name === "spinach" ? (
        <Spinach />
      ) : (
        <DefaultProfile />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Profile;
```

Detail the route object profile don't have any children and is rendering one single component `Profile`. When using dynamic segments is the parent component who manage which component needs to be render. 

>[!important]
>When a dynamic segment is created, the path is expecting any URL param, that will be use for the parent component who will take that param and do some logic to render the appropriate component. Meaning, in this case, to render the default profile component, the route should be something like `/profile/anythinghere`, meaning, the path **needs** a name. 
>
>At this moment, there is not a route define when the path don't have a name, like `/profile`

### Dynamic segment with no URL param
At this point, the router has two main routes: `/` and `/profile/:name`, but there is no case when the path is `/profile`, therefore, a 404 page will appear. There are two solutions for this:

1. Add a defined route for the `/profile`.

```jsx
{
    path: "profile",  // Handle /profile
    element: <DefaultProfile />,
},
```

1. Make the URL param optional 

```jsx
{
  path: "profile/:name?",
  element: <Profile />,
}
```

However, there is a more robust way to handle bad URLs.

## Loader, URL params and dynamic segments
If the loader need the URL param to direct data access, or anything else, pass the params property to the loader, and use it to call using dot notation the URL param.

```jsx
// loader file
export async function bookDetailsLoader({ params }) {
  const bookData = await fetchBookFromAPI(params.bookId);
  
  if (!bookData) {
    throw new Error("Book not found!");
  }
  
  return { bookData };
}

// Component
import { useLoaderData } from "react-router-dom";

function BookDetails() {
  const { bookData } = useLoaderData();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{bookData.title}</h1>
      <p>Author: {bookData.author}</p>
      <p>Published: {bookData.year}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// Router
{
  path: "/books/:bookId",
  element: <BookDetails />,
  loader: bookDetailsLoader
}
```
