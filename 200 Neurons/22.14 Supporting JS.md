# How to support JS 
To import JS code, add `"allowJs": true`  property to the `tsconfig.json` file. `"checkJs": true` will make the compiler trying to infer the types of the imported JS files; `"maxNodeModuleDepth"` indicates the level in which the compiler will infer types, the higher the value, more types will be inferred but slower performance.

When using check js, the inference is determine by the quality of the JS code, meaning, the inference could or could not be the best. 

Any library that is supported in TS must include the declaration file; some library, for example, an internal team library could not have that, so I have to support JS. There are more disadvantages of allowing JS in a TS project.
