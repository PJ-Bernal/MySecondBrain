When calling validate problems passing the model state, an action on the Controller Base class is being executed. However, the ValidationProblem method doesn't take into account how the ApiController is configure to behave on invalid model states.

Detail we configure the invalid model state response factory, that is not being use by the validation problem method in the action method controller; is only use when input is validate via the model binder.

# Fix that
Override that validation method in the controller, instead of returning base.validationproblem, I need the invalidmodelStateResponseFactory, as configured previously, to handle that.

First, create an instance of API behavior options, calling get required services on the request service collection.

Then execute on the options the custom  invalid model state response factory, that expects a current controller context as parameter.

# Testing
Now is working, detail the 422 and the response body error has the cusom fields detail, instance and type.
