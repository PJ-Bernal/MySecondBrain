[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

When a track is created, a line is created implicitly. Grid lines are only created after our grid tracks have been defined. We can not explicitly create grid lines (first I create the space, the track, then the line is created by itself). 

Every line is numbered from left to right, top to button starting at 1; so if I have a 3x3 grid, I will have line columns and rows from 1 to 4. 

>[!important]
>- Grid lines are use to position grid elements. 
>- The developer tools will show negative lines that could be also use to position elements.
