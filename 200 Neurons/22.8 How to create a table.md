## Naming the table
>[!multi-column]

>Within the SQL IDE in the phpMyAdmin webpage, insert `CREATE TABLE` followed by the table name and a `( );`, which must be different from an existing SQL keyword or any protected word. In this case, SQL showing me some keywords I must avoid.

Within `( );` I can create all the columns of my table.

>The last line of code within the `( )` mustn't have a comma. 

## Create columns
After defining the name of the column and it's data type I can write the following properties:
- `NOT NULL` to prevent the column value data store on it being NULL. 
- `AUTO_INCREMENT`, the column is going to be handled by itself, so the count of every new register of data will increment automatically (first user is 0, the next is 1, etc.)
- `DEFAULT` in case the user don't store any data, but I still want the table store a default value. 

>It's recommendable to have a integer ID for each register user. 

## Primary key
PK can be defined at the end of the column statement writing `PRIMARY KEY`, but is better to do it at the end of the table writing `PRIMARY KEY(column name)`. 
## Foreign key
The FK is a column that relates two tables. Is common to use the PK name of the 'parent' table in the 'child' table as the FK. 

>[!important]
>The FK must be define with the same data type and ( ) used in the parent table.
### `ON DELETE CASCADE`
When the PK register is deleted, all the associated FK register will also be deleted. The default behavior of `ON DELETE` is `NO ACTION` which will cause a problem.

### `ON DELETE SET NULL`
In this case, when the PK register is deleted, the register in the table who have the FK will be set to null. In this case, the FK can't be NOT NULL.

## Basic table
A basic table might look like this.
