## `Function` and `Object` as the first link
>[!blank-container|float-right]

The very first link in the chain is the `Object` and `Function` objects; the last one is in charge of create function declarations or instances (without or with the `new` keyword respectively) of any function type: arrow, defined, CF, etc. Therefore, `Array`, `Date`, etc. inherits from `Object` and `Function`.

Thus, **all types of functions** are instances of this `Function` Constructor, **all arrays** are instances of `Array`, etc.**all** objects inherit from `Object`. Thus, all `Function` instances have access to all `Function` methods, the same goes for `Array`, `Object`, etc. 

```js
function test1 () {}

console.log(typeof test1); // function
console.log(test1 instanceof Function); // true

let test2 = new Array();
console.log(typeof test2); // object
console.log(test2 instanceof Array); // true
console.log(test2 instanceof Function); // false
```

### The circular reference
Because `Function` is CF, meaning, it is both the constructor for all functions and an instance of itself, its `[[Prototype]]` came from its own `prototype`.

```js
console.log(Function.prototype === Object.getPrototypeOf(Function)); // true
```

![[Pasted image 20240813083708.png|300]]

This is done by including inside the `prototype` of `Function` a `[[Prototype]]` that references to `Object.prototype`.

There is no `[[Prototype]]` without a `prototype`, therefore, the very first link in this whole chain is the `prototype` of `Object`.

>Because `Object` doesn't even have a `prototype` property, is what we say the chain stops with `Object`. `Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype)` returns null.

Don't confuse the circular reference with the inheritance chain. Remember, the chain is create when using the `[[Prototype]]` of the object, so, if a method or attribute is not within the object definition, JS will go one link down in the chain and look its `[[Prototype]]`. This image shows the chain of a `p` node.
