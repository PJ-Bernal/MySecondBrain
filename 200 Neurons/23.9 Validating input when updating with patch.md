This is not right because when updating a course without a description shouldn't be a valid update. 

The og code. Detailing the signature, the parameter is a patch document, and not directly a course for update dto, this means, the validation from this dto are not bring into the put method.

Regarding the implementation, that patch document is apply to course for update dto, but after that there's no automatic validation of the type we apply the patch to.

Meaning there's a need for manually validate the course for update dto AFTER applying the patch document has been applied to, to see if the dto is still valid. If not, we shouldn't map or send it into the repo. 

To do that, use the try validate model helper method defined on the controller base class, that will triggers validation on the model after the patch is apply and any errors will end up in the model state. 

If the validate mode is false, the I return validation problems.

# Testing
Detail the 400, validation is working.

# Validating the json patch document itself
The document can be syntactically correct but semantically wrong, for example, if the patch instructions remove a property that doesn't exist, like this, that result in an exception, but this is mistake the client made, so not a 500 but a 400 something error.

I can send validation issues like that end in the model state, passing the model state to the apply to method, and then, the if will take care of returning that error if the model state is invalid.

Now look the 400, but still this is a boiler plate response, this is not returning the custom error created before, that includes the type property on the response body. Also, the correct status should be 422.
