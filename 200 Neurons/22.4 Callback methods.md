[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

I can pass methods call as arguments to other methods, always being mindful of what the methods are returning. 

>[!important]
>I can use a method as an argument for itself, as seen in the last example. Here the parenthesis is required to avoid confusion.

```ruby

def add(a, b)
  a + b
end

def subtract(a, b)
  a - b
end

def multiply(num1, num2)
  num1 * num2
end

multiply(add(20, 45), subtract(80, 10))
=> 4550

add(subtract(80, 10), multiply(subtract(20, 6), add(30, 5)))
=> 560
```
