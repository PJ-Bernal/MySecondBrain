[[13.2 Project management]]

BDD is not for discovering what product to build, thus, product owners should have a clear conception of what the product is. BDD is for building the correct product for end users. 

## Steps for a BDD process

What if there is ambiguity in the acceptance criteria? Solve that using mapping.

>This is an example of mapping using cards, the idea is to create a visual representation of the user story using four different colors. A yellow card contains the name of the story itself. Blue represent rules, the acceptance criteria. Green provides concrete examples, placed them under the related rule card. Red, questions can't be answer during the meeting.

Therefore, the user story can be refined and truly defined the acceptance criteria. BDD focuses on conversations, so having those before any code development is not desirable but requirable. 
## Concrete examples
BDD is based on concrete examples, and acceptance criteria.

### What do a concrete example look like?

Is easy to confuse concrete examples with features. This is what an example should not look like: as a barista, I'm responsible for inventory. When an item is low, I order more. So, as for an specific example to understand how the user would use the system.

Concrete example should have context and situational awareness, maybe naming actors or people involve in the example.

Client, developer and tester should be develop with these three aspects in mind.
