## Create the schema
Database tables and schemas are going to change. In this I create a table called ghosts, that has 5 columns (the `.timestamps` method creates two columns by itself) plus the ID column that is automatically created. 

![[Pasted image 20240528114936.png]]

Detail I'm writing Rails code and not a single line of SQL. The above code is the same as the following SQL.

```SQL
  CREATE TABLE "ghosts" (
    "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
    "name" varchar(255),
    "phone" varchar(255),
    "age" integer,
    "created_at" datetime NOT NULL,
    "updated_at" datetime NOT NULL)
```

>[!important]
>The schema for **all the tables** should be defined within the 'migrations' file. So, within the change or up methods, all the schemas should be defined.
>```ruby
>class CreateBooks < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
>  def change
>    create_table :authors do |t|
>      t.string :name
>      t.timestamps
>    end
>
>    create_table :books do |t|
>      t.belongs_to :author
>      t.datetime :published_at
>      t.timestamps
>    end
>  end
>end
>
>```

However, the following code is db-agnostic and will run in MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.

```ruby
class CreatePublications < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    create_table :publications do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.text :description
      t.references :publication_type
      t.timestamps
    end
    create_table :people do |t|
	  t.string :name
	  t.text :last_name
	end
  end
end
```

[question:: all the schemas should be defined within the same change or up method?]
### Example
This migration adds a table called products with a string column called name and a text column called description. A primary key column called id will also be added implicitly, as it's the default primary key for all Active Record models. The timestamps macro adds two columns, created_at and updated_at. These special columns are automatically managed by Active Record if they exist. 
```ruby
class CreateProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    create_table :products do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.text :description

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

>[!important]
>- Using the `change` method I'm creating a change forward in time, so AR knows what to migrate forwards and backwards; without using the up or down methods. Or I can use up and down as the image.
>- The `[7.1]` is not required but acts as a version specifier to indicate the Rails version with which the migration was generated. This is useful when working with multiple versions of Rails and to ensure compatibility. 

## Making reversible changes
The reversible keyword in the provided Rails migration code is used to define reversible changes within a migration. This allows you to specify how to perform both the up and down operations in a single block,  making the migration easier to read and maintain. 

In this `reversible do |direction|` line, reversible is a method that takes a block and passes it an object, typically named direction that provides instructions defining what happen with the migration run un or down. 
```ruby
class ChangeProductsPrice < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    reversible do |direction|
      change_table :products do |t|
        direction.up   { t.change :price, :string }
        direction.down { t.change :price, :integer }
      end
    end
  end
end
```
