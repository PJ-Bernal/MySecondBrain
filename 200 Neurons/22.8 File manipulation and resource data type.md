[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

To open and read a file line by line, use `fopen()`, the first argument is the file name, the second is the mode, [this page](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fopen.php) show all the modes, for example to open a file for reading, writing, both, etc. 

## Open local files
The `r` of `fopen()` is a resource data type, that is a variable that refers to an external resource, which can be a string, file, etc. Some built-in functions in PHP create, return and work with resources.

`fopen()` return false and emit a warning if the file is not found.  ^4860de

If the file exists, the function will return the resources data type. (foo file content is 'hello world').

## Open remote files
I can do this by specifying the URL, but this might not work always because opening file remotely might be disable by the server. 

## Error control operator
Error control operator should be used to suppress [[22.8 File manipulation and resource data type#^4860de|this]] warning, this is occasional, but is a little common in code bases. 

What developers do is add the `@` operator to suppress (eliminate) the browser for appearing on the browser, but check if the return is false to see if the file was opened. successfully or not.

## Read file line by line
In this case the content of foo is 'hello' break line 'world'. To read use the `fgets()` function, which in this example, is getting assign to a variable. This loop every line until the return value is false.

Detail strict comparison is used, because the return value of fget might be a value that could be evaluated to a false (0, for example). So, when the fgets don't have any more lines, it returns 0, which is different from false and the while ends.

## Close file
When done with the file, close using `fclose()`. 

![[Pasted image 20240310185939.png|center|350]]

## Write from a file. 
Use `fwrite`

## Read CSV files
`fgetcsv()` parses the line when it reads it and returns an array that contains the fields it has read; the default delimiter for fields is comma, but I can change that passing it as an argument. 

In this example the foo content is a, b, c break line d, e, f break line g, h, i.

Each line is return as an array. 

## Read a file using get file contents 
This store the file content into a variable. Here the content of foo is hello world.

![[Pasted image 20240310190416.png|center|400]]


I can specified the offset and length to get the content at a specific location.

![[Pasted image 20240310190536.png|center]]

Or get the content of a remote file by specifying the url, but as always, this might not work depending on the configuration of the server. 

>The above is not the best wat to get the content of a remote file, is better to use a library call curl.
## Write content
Does the same as fopen, fwrite and fclose, combined. If the file don't exists, it will create, otherwise it will overwrite. I can also append content instead of overwrite, by specifying the flag in the third argument.  

Here, bar.txt don't exists. So it will create that file and put hello in it.

![[Pasted image 20240310191011.png]]

The browser gets refreshed and the document is created.

![[Pasted image 20240310191433.png|center|300]]


If the function is call again, it will overwrite the content. 

![[Pasted image 20240310191537.png|center]]
![[Pasted image 20240310191611.png|center|350]]

To append use file append constant.

## Delete files
Use unlink(). 

![[Pasted image 20240310191910.png|center]]



## Copy files
Use copy().

![[Pasted image 20240310191957.png|center]]
![[Pasted image 20240310192033.png]]
If the file already exists at destination it will be overwirte.

## Move files or directories
Use rename.

```PHP
<?php
rename("/tmp/tmp_file.txt", "/home/user/login/docs/my_file.txt");
?>
```

This image is based on the image above
![[Pasted image 20240310192259.png|center]]

The file foo is delete because I move to an already create file. 

## To get information about a file
Use pathinfo(file name) that will return an array with useful liek file name, extension, etc.
