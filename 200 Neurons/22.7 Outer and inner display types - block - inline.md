## The principal box

## The formatting context
Formatting context is the environment into which a set of related principal boxes are laid out. 

In CSS we have several types of boxes that generally fit into the categories of block boxes and inline boxes. The type refers to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page. Boxes have an inner display type and an outer display type.

- There are several display layout modes (grid, flex, etc.) that end up referring to the block and inline formatting context to position things (how the box is going to be positioned).

>[!info]- Box vs element
>The term box is more appropriate because a box can contantain multiple elements; rather than en element that's only one.   

>[!important]
>- Outer display type: how the box position/relates itself and interacts with **other boxes**; dictates how the principal box itself participates in flow layout.
>- Inner display type (flex, grid , etc.): dictates how elements inside that box,  its descendant boxes are laid out. Parts inside the element may have different display types.

Check [this list](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp) to know all inline and block elements. 

>Although all block have a `display` value by default, it can be override to get another results, for example making inline `li` elements for horizontal menus.
## Outer display type
A box can have a block or inline outer display, each will comply certain conditions. 
### Outer display type of block
>[!multi-column]
>
> - The box will break into a new line (so each element can't have other elements at its sides); thus, block boxes are laid out one after the other, vertically, beginning at the top of a containing block.
> - Each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block.
> - Width and height properties are respected; this values gives the size of the whole box model. Using % will take the value of the parent. 
> - Padding, margin vary the size of the content box by pushing it inward. Whereas margin will push other elements away from the whole box. See [[22.7 Outer and inner display types - block - inline#Margin|margins]].
>
>>- If `width` is not specified, the box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container. In most cases, the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available, regardless the padding and border values, they will extend to cover the full viewport.
>>- The size of the box model is affected by the `box-sizing` property. 

>[!warning]
>- Margings will keep overlapping and to put other boxes they should have a block behavior aswell.
>- Boxes pushes each other in all directions unless the box margin reaches the viewport. 
>- Some HTML elements such as `h` and `p` use `block` as their outer display type by default.
>- I can think the positioning as a physical box that considers the element dimensions inside the box, padding, border and marging (alert, marging overcomes other margins). 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240202114211.png]]
>Box-one pushes box two down by 20px, 10px and 50px, here the margin overlaps.
>![[Pasted image 20240202114511.png]]
>Here, box-two is not pushing up box-one as the box-one margin is reaching the upper viewport. That's why box-two ended up "pushing itself" down and box one stais in the same position.

>[!example]- Width and height
>![[Pasted image 20240202124520.png]]
>Because width and height is respectd in boxes with a block display, when the specified dimensions are higher than the element itself, the element will render as it is and the rest will be 'empty space'.

>[!example]- Size of the box
>![[Pasted image 20240205105529.png]]
>The size of the box is given by the width and height values. The content box will change dynamically depending on the padding.  
>![[Pasted image 20240205105552.png]]
>The second image, the padding increases, the content box decreases and the size of the element is the already stablished width and height. 
>>In both scenarios the box size was 100x100.
### Outer display type of inline
>[!multi-column]
>
> - The box will not break into a new line.
> - Width and height properties are ignored. Thus, the size of online box is just the size 
> - Top and bottom padding, margins, and borders will be 'painted' but won't cause other boxes being push away from the current box, or the box itself being push, like in the example below both boxes are on the top of the viewport.  (detail the second image).
>
>>- Left and right padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box. 
>>- See [[22.7 Outer and inner display types - block - inline#Margin|margins]].
>>- Inline can wrap some text inside a paragraph without disrupting its content.
>>- The content box size is the same regardless the values of the padding, border or margin. The last two only change the size of the box model.  

>[!example]
>![[Pasted image 20240202121002.png]]
>Detail how the height value isnot working and how the first box is pushing the second. The height is not taking into account to display the element, only the left and right properties. 
>![[Pasted image 20240422132233.png]]
>The padding top and bottom are present, but overlap over the lines above and under.

>[!warning]
>- I can think the positioning as a physical box that considers the element width inside the box, and left and right padding, border and marging (alter, margings will respect each other, don't overlap other margins). 
>- `a`, `span`, `em` and `strong` use `inline` by default. 

>[!example]- Width and height
>![[Pasted image 20240202124722.png]]
>Width and height dimensions are not taking into acccount, so the element will always render as it is with NO empty space. The only way to change "the elements' dimensions" is with a padding. 

>[!example]- Size of the box
>![[Pasted image 20240205105742.png]]
>Width and height values don't apply. The content box size is only affected by the size of the element (p, img, etc.). Padding and border won't push the content box, but affect the size of the box.
>![[Pasted image 20240205105847.png]]
>Detail the padding increases but the content box remains the same and the size of the element changes. 

>What if I want a inline block have a height or width value? Check [[22.7 Outer and inner display types - block - inline#Using `display inline-block`|inline-block]].
### Outer display type of none
Some specialized elements such as `script` use this as their default. This is different from `visibility`. Setting `display` to `none` will render the page as though the element does not exist. `visibility: hidden;` will hide the element, but the element will still take up the space it would if it was fully visible. ^c82fc3

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240205113814.png]]
>Detail how in the inspector, the element tag doesn't have a color. is not even render.
>![[Pasted image 20240205113857.png]]
>With visibility hidden, the element's space is there, but is just invisible. With visibility I can alter the display to either block or inline.

## Display property and changing display roles
According to the [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#the-display-properties) there is the `||` bar, indicating how to declare the outside (outer) and inside (inner) display of an element

>[!example]-
>`display: inline;`, `display: block;`, `display: inline flex;`, `display: block flex;`

The display property of an element is interchangeable regardless if its a direct descendant (speaking about HTML).

>[!example]-
>Here, em is a descendant of p, however I can change the display of both.
>```html
><p>This is a paragraph with <em>an inline element</em> within it.</p>
>```
>```css
>p {display: inline;}
>em {display: block;}
>```

[question:: correct the flexbox in which I wrote inline-flex or box-flex is right, that is legacy, now is inline flex or block flex]
## Inner display type
Block and inline layout is the default way things behave on the web. By default and without any other instruction, the elements inside a box are also laid out in normal flow and behave as block or inline boxes. Some examples of inner values are: `table`, `flex`, `grid`, etc. 

>[!info]
>Changing the inner display won't necesarily affect the outer. For example, `display: flex;` the inner display  have changed to `flex` (so it's children) but the outer is still `block`. 

[question:: how is that the blox is block? why not inline by default.]

## Example of inner and outter displays
Check [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#examples_of_different_display_types) examples. Detail how a block element like `ul`, even though with a `display: flex;` keeps its block, but its children change. 

>[!warning]
>Changing the value of the `display` property can change whether the outer display type of a box is block or inline ONLY. `display` can change the inner display in several ways, block, inline, etc.
