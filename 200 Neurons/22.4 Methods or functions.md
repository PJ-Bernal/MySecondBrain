[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

>[!quote]
>Many languages distinguish between functions, which have no associated object, and methods, which are invoked on a receiver object. Because Ruby is a purely object-oriented language, all methods are true methods and are associated with at least one object.

Basically, because everything in Ruby is an object, Ruby has methods, not functions. So a class has methods, not functions.
