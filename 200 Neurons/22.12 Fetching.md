[[12.12 React|React]]

Is recommended to fetch request inside of the `useEffect` hook to prevent infinite loops; if the fetch is outside of the hook, the request will happen on every render. And because the fetching is considerate a side effect because interacts with an external system, it can't be computed from a prop or state and is async. 

Detail inside of fetch are the setters to update the state. 

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const Image = () => {
  const [imageURL, setImageURL] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos", { mode: "cors" })
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((response) => setImageURL(response[0].url))
      .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  }, []);

  return (
    imageURL && (
      <>
        <h1>An image</h1>
        <img src={imageURL} alt={"placeholder text"} />
      </>
    )
  );
};

export default Image;
```

Remember an empty dependency array runs the effect once on mount, if it has arguments it will run when those change. If the array is not present at all it will run on every render. 

>Remember a fetching should have a minimum of three states for optimal user experience: data, loading an error. See the other notes for a complete example. There are more useful states like: success, stale, last update timestamp, retry count, abort state, etc.
