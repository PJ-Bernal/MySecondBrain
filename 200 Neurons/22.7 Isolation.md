## The isolation rule
This rule creates a new stacking context **without** a required z index value. This is extremely useful when embedding a react component. If the component don't have an isolate stacking context, the components z indexes might interfere with other elements of the page.

The component must be re usable, so using `position: relative; z-index: 1`, for example, give the component a defined z index value that could be wrong or inappropriate.
