# About the endpoints explorer
Endpoints explorer is a tool window that integrates with HTTP file editor for testing. View -> other views -> endpoints explorer.

Out of the box, it detects potential request.

For each one I can see the controller, method, and file path.

# Generate a .http file with a request
Right click -> generate request. Then, the file (left) is automatically created.

If I generate this for the second method, the request is added to the same http file.

>Though the request could be empty is a good starting point.
