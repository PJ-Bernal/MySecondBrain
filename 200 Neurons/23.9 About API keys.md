# About API keys
The key is an encrypted string that is send on each request to the API, typically in a custom header or as a query string value; then the api validates the key.

API keys are static in nature, meaning, they give access for a long time, days, months. Contrary to cookies or tokens that are short-lived. 

Also, the consumer needs the key, so safely storing the key is extremely important; generally not even on the browser, but a server. This is a problem if I don't have control over the app, image having a JS app, the key may be store in a place accessible for JS, like the local storage or in the session, this is a risk.

# Generating an API key
The API is responsible for validating the key, and not generate it. Usually, keys are generated by a custom app that manages keys for client apps.

Though is not require, this is the boiler plate to generate a key.
