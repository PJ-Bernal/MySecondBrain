Make the mapping service reusable converting it into an extension method, name ApplySort. 

The repo is in charge for ordering, so the repo must call the method. That method will need the property mapping service, first inject it into the constructor, by constructor injection.

The og code.

Then create the author property mapping dictionary. 

![[Pasted image 20250206100206.png]]

Then, use the apply sort method, that will replace the manual checking and ordering of line 174.

# Creating the apply sort method
add a new class to helpers, that will contain methods of Iqueriable. Add the static keyword because this will be an extension method.

First, check the input. 

![[Pasted image 20250206100526.png]]

Create an empty string variable and slit the input, in this case, according to the method parameters, is order by. Then, trim.

Then sort desc if sort ends in desc, if not asc.

![[Pasted image 20250206100802.png]]

Then, remove the asc or desc from the order by clause to get the property name to look in the mapping dictionary.

![[Pasted image 20250206100847.png]]

Find the key with the property name, if not found throw, if exists, get it; if is null, throw again. 

![[Pasted image 20250206100946.png]]

Then, for reverse sorting like with age, revert the sorting.

![[Pasted image 20250206101030.png]]

Then, run through all property names and construct the final order by stirng.

![[Pasted image 20250206101053.png]]

Finally, for each item in the split order by string, apply the full sort expression.

![[Pasted image 20250206101134.png]]

# Into the repo
Apply the method.

![[Pasted image 20250206101152.png]]

# Testing
Order name asc

![[Pasted image 20250206101217.png]]

This is desc

![[Pasted image 20250206101249.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250206101313.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250206101450.png]]

Combined

Sorting and paging, the response body is ok, but the previous page linkd ont contain the sorting order any more.
