# About Kestrel

Before ASP.NET Core, a plan ASP.NET app require the use of IIS to run the app. ISS is a windows server, therefore, this worked not well with cross-platform. 

For that reason, kestrel was created, to be cross-platform. 

Typically, every ASP.NET Core app will run on Kestrel; every ASP.NET Core app host themselves in a Kestrel server. I could directly let Kestrel also host the site on the internet; however, most often is common to put a reverse proxy in between that will receive the request and hand it to the actual server (which in the image is kestrel). 

In this case, in the image, the reverse proxy is connected to the internet and Kestrel is only connected to the reverse proxy. This is good for security.

Using this implementation, the server now is cross-platform and now can run behind different reverse proxies on different OS in the exact same way. This means, the app is decoupled entirely from the OS. 

ISS or APACHE are better when fighting threats as servers connected to the web.  Kestrel remains lightweight and doesnâ€™t have to bother with all these extra measures. 

Those are the benefits on running the app on its own lightweight server. 

Kestrel is also aprt of the chain of execution that creates the HTTP context use in the app. This context contains all relevant information of the incoming request receive by the server.
