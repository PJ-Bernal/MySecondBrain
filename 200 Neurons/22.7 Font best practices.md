## How fonts affect performance
- Delayed text rendering: if a web font has not loaded, browsers typically delay text rendering.
- Layout shifts: impact the CLS, the font takes different amounts of space on the page.

## Font life cycle
### Font loading
Fonts should get loaded as early as possible; so take special attention for fonts downloaded from third-party sites. 

#### How to check if my font is being requested in time
Within the network tab, check the timing. [question:: and then check what...]

#### Optimization with font face
The first optimization about font loading is found in [[22.7 Fonts styles#Self hosted fonts|how font-face works]]. Additionally, splitting stylesheets can reduce the number of fonts loaded by a page.

#### Optimization with inline font declarations
Some sites could find some benefit with inlining font declarations and other critical styling in the `head` of the HTML file. 

```HTML
<head>
  <style>
    @font-face {
        font-family: "Open Sans";
        src: url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2") format("woff2");
    }
    body {
        font-family: "Open Sans";
    }
    ...etc.

  </style>
</head>
```

The browser doesn't need to wait for external stylesheet to download to discover the font. 

>[!important] This is not always desire
>Because inline CSS is not recommended, only the most critical CSS should be inline.

#### Preconnect to critical third-party origins
Use `rel=preconnect` resource hint, if the site use third-party load fonts, to establish an early connection with the third-party origin. It must be place in the head.

The following line of code tells the browser to preconnect to `"https://fonts.com"`, therefore the browser will perform the DNS lookup, TCP handshake, and TLS negotiation early.  This preconnect establish a connection without [[22.2 HTTP security#CORS|CORS]]. When using `link` elements they should be as early in the document as possible. 

```html
<head>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.com">
</head>
```

Now, some providers may serve the stylesheets and the actual font data in separate origins. This is the case of Google fonts:

- The stylesheet that specifies which fonts to use is served from `https://fonts.googleapis.com`
- The font files themselves (the actual font data) are served from `https://fonts.gstatic.com`

Therefore, a second preconnect statement is required to download the actual font data file and to ensure a preconnection that follows CORS (font files **must be** be servered with appropriate CORS headers), thus, the `crossorigin` keyword is added. 

```HTML
<head>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.com" crossorigin>
</head>
```

In the case of Google fonts, the stylesheet and the font file are in different origins, so the snippets could look like this:

```css
<head>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
</head>
```

>[!imporant] `link` vs `import`
>Google fonts use both elements, however, `link` includes a `preconnect` resulting in a faster stylesheet delivery than using `@import`. 

#### Be cautious when using preload to load fonts
>Although preload is highly effective at making fonts discoverable early in the page load process, this comes at the cost of taking away browser resources from the loading of other resources.

Browsers have mechanisms to decided how and when to load different resources based on the needs of the page and the user. `preload` bypass these strategies. In addition to that, the browser will fetch the entire font file regardless because `preload` ignores the `unicode-range` declaration, which cause larger downloads. 

>However, when using external stylesheets, preloading the most important fonts can be very effective since the browser won't otherwise discover whether the font is needed until much later.


### Font delivery
Faster delivery result in faster rendering and almost no layout shifts. 
#### When using self-hosted fonts
In practice, when implementing a self-hosted font or a third-party resource, is not clear which one is faster; in some cases the later can be faster! 

For self-hosted fonts I should confirm the site is using a CDN and HTTP/2. Without use of these technologies, it is much less likely that self-hosted fonts will deliver better performance.

#### Subset fonts
Fonts have a large number of glyphs the page won't use, so I can reduce the font file size by subsetting the font using the `unicode-range: U+0025-00FF;`. This property is specifically used within the `@font-face` ruleset (so I have to self host the font to use the unicode range).

```CSS
@font-face {
    font-family: "Open Sans";
    src: url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2") format("woff2");
    unicode-range: U+0025-00FF;
}
```

A font file will be downloaded if the page contains one or more characters matching the unicode range. unicode-range is commonly used to serve different font files depending on the language used by page content.

#### Use fewer web fonts
The fastest font to deliver is a font that isn't requested in the first place, using system and variable fonts. A system font is the default font set by the user device, they vary from OS to OS.

To use a system font list system-ui as the font-family `font-family: system-ui;`. 

Variable fonts allow a single variable font to be used as a replacement for multiple font files. Variable fonts work by defining a "default" font style and providing "axes" for manipulating the font. However, variable fonts have larger file size because of its styles. 
### Font rendering
Font rendering has two stages:
- Block period: starts when the browser request the web font, if it isn't available, the font is rendered in an invisible fallback font and thus the text will not be visible to the user. If the font is not available at the end of the block period, it will be rendered in the fallback font.
- Swap period: after the block period, if the font is available, it will be swapped in. 

For Chromium-based and Firefox browsers, the block period is for 3 seconds; in Safari is unlimited. 

This behavior is controlled by the `font-family` property, that could impact the LCP, FCP and layout stability.
#### Choose an appropriate font-display strategy
This property tells the browser how to behave when a font has not loaded; and its values are between performance and aesthetics, so there is not a clear rule to use this property. 

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: Roboto, Sans-Serif
  src: url(/fonts/roboto.woff) format('woff'),
  font-display: swap;
}
```

![[Pasted image 20240620153143.png|center|450]]

The main three strategies for use this property are:
1. Performance as a top priority: use `font-display: optional`. The font won't be used if it arrives late.
2. Font quickly displayed but I want to use the web-font: `font-display: swap`, making sure the font arrives early enough to avoid layout shifts. 
3. Use the web font is a top priority: use `font-display: block`, the initial font will be delayed and the web font can arrive late, so this will prone layout shifting. 
4. Though almost all values can cause some CLS, `font-display: swap` is used for situations in which I want to display the text as soon as possible but ultimately I want it to render to the we font. 

I can use different values in my CSS, for example, `font-display: swap` for branding and other visually distinctive page elements; use `font-display: optional` for fonts used in body text.
