[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

A RESTful API can have multiple modifiable (added, remove, modify) architecture layers, but no layer can access a layer that's beyond the next one. 

The client doesn't need to know to which layer is connected to, for example, if its connected directly to the server or some load balancer. 

REST restricts knowledge to a single layer, the outer-facing one.
