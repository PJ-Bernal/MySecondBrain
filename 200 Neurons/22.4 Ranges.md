[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

I can use the Range class instance to determine how many times my loop is going to run, given ruby an including or excluding interval.

```ruby
(1..5)      # inclusive range: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
(1...5)     # exclusive range: 1, 2, 3, 4

# We can make ranges of letters, too!
('a'..'d')  # a, b, c, d
```
