[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

## Accessing PHP built in classes
PHP will try to load classes from the current namespace, when I'm on a namespace file. To access built in classes from a namespace I have to add `\` to tell PHP to load from the global space or I have to import them.

In this example I want to access a built-in class name `DateTime()`, but the file is under the `PaymentGateway\Paddle` name space. Therefore, an error happens because the class don't exists within the name space. 

Detail the error is saying the class is not found in the name space.

If I don't import the class or function, I need to use the `\`.

When importing the function, detail the `\`is not required. (like importing a class, see [[22.8 How to define a namespace#Import class from the name space|Importing name spaces]])

In this case, explode is being resolve from the global space using the built in function, but why this work with functions and no classes?

>[!warning] Scope for functions & constants is different from classes!
>For classes, PHP will try to locate them in the local namespace, and throw an error if it doesn't exists (unless I use `use` to import that class). But, with functions and constants, if the function doesn't exists if the local namespace, then it falls back to the global namespace (in this case, explode doesn't exists in the local namespace, so it falls back to the global name space). 

### What happen with custo functions?
This is the proof that functions and constants resolve first to the local space, and then to the global space.

>[!warning] Built in? Or customer function/constat
>To avoid using a customer function instead of a built-in, or vice versa. Always use the use the `\`
>to ensure I'm using PHP built in functions from the global and not the local namespace. Doing this could have some speed improvements because I'm telling PHP exactly where to look for a function instead of letting it resolve.
