# About tuples
## The array problem
Tuples are a special type of array where its length is fixed and each element has a specific type. 

Arrays in TS have a problem when inferring the types of the value on each index. For example, even though this array came from a API table where I know the column names (year, make, model), TS is not able to infer the types specifically when destructing. 

This is because the whole array is the type `let myCar: (string|number)[]`, therefore, TS thinks all elements should be either string or number. 

```ts
let myCar = [
    2002,     // Year
    "Toyota", // Make
    "Corolla" // Model
]
const [year, make, model] = myCar //✔️ Destructuring
```

Additionally, arrays don't constraint the variable to have a define number of members and the same order. This example is using a different convention of what is suppose to be my car; the year, make, and model are not in order, and the price is added. 

```ts
myCar = ["Honda", "version1", 2022, 70.500]  
```

## What tuples solve
Tuples allow to define the type of each element, and the number of elements; solving the array's problem. To type a tuple use `:[<type>, <type>, <type>]`.

Now, the tuple (not the array) is the type `myCar: [number string, string]`, and not `myCar: (string|number)[]`, detail the tuples don't use the `[]` of the arrays. 

```ts
let myCar: [number, string, string] = [
    2002,
    "Toyota",
    "Corolla",
]
myCar = ["Honda", 2017, "Accord"] //! Wrong convention
myCar = [2017, "Honda", "Accord", "Sedan"] //! Too many elements
```

Now, TS is doing its type checking, check the number of elements, and its order.

>[!important]
>When using arrays, there's no real way to tell TS, the first element is an string, the second is a number, etc. That's why using tuples is useful.

# Use cases
- For function return values, for an successful or failure, or the string error and the error, etc.
# Errors with tuples
Tuples are in essence JS arrays, meaning when pushing, popping, etc. TS won't make any checking. This means TS do its checks only during the tuple initialization.

## readonly arrays
When an array is read only, TS will treat it as an immutable array. So the type is not a tuple as is, but a read only tuple. However, by doing this, the tuple values can't be change.
