# About tuples
## The array problem
Tuples are a special type of array where its length is fixed and each element has a specific type. 

Arrays in TS have a problem when inferring the types of the value on each index. For example, even though this array came from a API table where I know the column names (year, make, model), TS is not able to infer the types specifically when destructing. 

For an array, all elements have the same type, otherwise it must use union types, and in some cases there's no need for that. Also, the order and structure of an array doesn't matter. 

This is because the whole array is the type `let myCar: (string|number)[]`, therefore, TS thinks all elements should be either string or number. 

```ts
let myCar = [
    2002,     // Year
    "Toyota", // Make
    "Corolla" // Model
]
const [year, make, model] = myCar //✔️ Destructuring
```

Additionally, arrays don't constraint the variable to have a define number of members and the same order. This example is using a different convention of what is suppose to be my car; the year, make, and model are not in order, and the price is added. 

```ts
myCar = ["Honda", "version1", 2022, 70.500]  
```

## What tuples solve - creating a tuple
Use tuples when I need to define the type of each element, and its order in the tuple matters, hence the tuple's length is fixed". Solving the array's problem. To type a tuple use `:[<type>, <type>, <type>]`.

Now, the tuple (not the array) is the type `myCar: [number string, string]`, and not `myCar: (string|number)[]`, detail the tuples don't use the `[]` of the arrays. 

```ts
let myCar: [number, string, string] = [
    2002,
    "Toyota",
    "Corolla",
]
myCar = ["Honda", 2017, "Accord"] //! Wrong convention
myCar = [2017, "Honda", "Accord", "Sedan"] //! Too many elements
```

Now, TS is doing its type checking, check the number of elements, and its order.

This is another example:

>[!important]
>- When using arrays, there's no real way to tell TS, the first element is an string, the second is a number, etc. That's why using tuples is useful.
>- Tuples allow for an array to hold a specific data type in each index. Imagine the tuple as a row of a table in a db, this means, there is a finite number of elements in the tuple and I know the type of each index. 

When creating a tuple I can indicate optional elements.

![[Pasted image 20250218124007.png|center]]
# Use cases
- For function return values, for an successful or failure, or the string error and the error, etc.
- Tuples can be seen as a row in a db table.  
# Errors with tuples
Tuples are in essence JS arrays, meaning when pushing, popping, etc. TS won't make any checking. This means TS do its checks only during the tuple initialization. Detail tuple length is suppose to be fixed, but I can push and pop elements... This is not correct.

## readonly arrays - tuples
Use `:readonly` to make a tuple immutable. This make the tuple a fixed length, and can't change its content. 

![[Pasted image 20250212140241.png]]

A read only tuple can be created when type asserting an array with `as const`. This is useful when I create an array with specific data, and I want Ts to infer the types instead of writing the types myself.

![[Pasted image 20250213094052.png|center|450]]

Detail in this case, TS infer the type as the value pass to the array, meaning TS will see this tuple as the type `[success, name, email]`, and not `[string, string, striing]`. I'm not defining directly the types.

# Destructing a union tuple
![[Pasted image 20250213100307.png]]

In this example, the function's return type is the union of a tuple, whose fires tuple is `readonly["success", {readonly name: "Mike North";readonly email: "mike@example.com";}]`, and the second tuple is `readonly ["error", Error]`.

Now, when destructing, TS infers the types of first, second, and third based on the union of the tuples.

```ts
["success", { name: "Mike North"; email: "mike@example.com" }, "test"] 
| ["error",                            Error                         ]
```

So when destructing:
