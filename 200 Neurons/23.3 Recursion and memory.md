The recursion depth dictates the number of context; each context execute the whole function again, therefore, it takes memory. **A loop-based algorithm** is memory-saving because in general it uses a single context.

>Any recursion can be rewritten as a loop. The loop variant usually can be made more effective. But sometimes the rewrite is non-trivial, especially when a function uses different recursive subcalls depending on conditions and merges their results or when the branching is more intricate. And the optimization may be unneeded and totally not worth the efforts.
