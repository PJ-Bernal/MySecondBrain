# About HATEOAS
HATEOAS makes API evolvable and self-describing. Links tells the consumer how to consume and interact with the API; this last part is important, because the API can show the consumer whatever links are useful to the consumer. 

For example, when requesting an account number, the consumer should be interested in other things about the account, so showing how to get, or delete the account is not the only thing useful. So, HATEOAS allows to include other things that are useful like this.

HATEOAS adds a dynamic self-descriptive layer to the API that can improve usability, flexibility, and maintainability. However, nowadays documentation is pretty clear and easy to produce, so not all REST APIs implement HATEOAS. 
## What problems does it resolve?

A consumer that receive a response body like that should have a previous knowledge about how the API works and is structured. 

The docs can shows the consumer how to send a request method to an specific endpoint, with an specific payload; but it can't get the information from the response itself.

Now, imagine a V2 of the API with an additional field. 

In this example, the consumer will have to know before hand about the field, in order to make a POST request. 

Meaning, the consumer might know intrinsic knowledge of the API, but I don't want to put that burden on the customer. If HATEOAS is not implemented, the consumer might need to know "to much" about the API. 

Also, if the API evolves, those changes may break the consumer applications because the assumptions make by those are invalid. 
## How HATEOAS is implemented
Include a links property on the resource that tell the consumer which methods are possible on the API. 

The client have to inspect the links, the links tell the consumer which functionality is able for the API; meaning, no link = no functionality.

Is up to the server whether or not show the links, so I can simply delete a link if needed. 

## Supporting HATEOAS in APIS
Links, forms, etc. Drive the application state. 
## How a link looks like
>[!blank-container|float-left-medium]
>![[Pasted image 20250206132639.png]]

JSON and XML don't know how to represent links, but HTML does; type is optional.

## HATEOAS for collections
>[!blank-container|float-left-medium]
>![[Pasted image 20250206132921.png]]

Use an object to hold a value with is the collection and the links. 

This is an envelop that holds both things but it breaks the self descriptive constraint and is not a valid JSON.
