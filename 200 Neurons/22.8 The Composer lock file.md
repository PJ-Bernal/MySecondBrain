## Composer lock file
This file locks dependencies to a fixed state (to a specific version), it contains all the packages and dependencies the project depends on with exact versions. 

>I can and should commit that log file to my version control system like git, to ensure everyone working in the project or from another computer are all using the same versions of dependencies.

### How this file get generated
When I run `composer install` if a lock file exists it will resolve and install all the dependencies listed in composer json file but it will use the exact versions that are listed in my lock file. 

If the lock file doesn't exists, then composer install will generate this lock file the same way composer require generated it. 

Composer **require**, **update**, and **remove** commands will also update the composer lock file, so when I run composer update it will update the dependencies base on the version I have specified in the composer.json file, and it will also update the composer log file.
