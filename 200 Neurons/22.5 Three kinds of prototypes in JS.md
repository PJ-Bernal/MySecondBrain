[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

The following are the ways JS allow prototype inheritance in JS:

1. Objects have delegate prototypes: objects rely on the prototype inheritance chain to inherit properties and methods from other objects. If a property/method is not found within the object, JS will look into its prototype and so on.
2. Objects have runtime extension: JS (being a [[22.5 Dynamic and weakly type|dynamic type language]]) have what is called a runtime object extension that make object mutable, so properties and methods can be added, modified or deleted after the object is created. 
3. Closures. 

## Delegation/differential inheritance
Is the classical object inheritance using [[22.5 What is an object - object creation - object constructors and object literals - user defined functions - add properties to object literals#How to create an object|Constructor Functions or object literals]]. If a property/method is not within a object definition, JS will check for its `[[Prototype]]`, etc. 

When the properties/methods are include within the `prototype`,
