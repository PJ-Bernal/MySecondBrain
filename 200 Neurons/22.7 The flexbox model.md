## Flexbox containers and items
Flexbox is a toolbox of properties that uses two types of boxes (different from block and inline boxes):

- Flex containers: An area of a document that is laid out using flexbox (box that groups flex items and define how they're positioned) (align, direction and order).

>Flex items can be manipulated individually, but for the most part, it’s up to the container to determine their layout.

- Flex items: Every HTML element that’s a direct child of a flex container (if my container five `p` tags, each tag is a flex item; if my container has a div containing those `p` tags, only the div is a flex item). Its flex capabilities allows each item to change its order and size.   
![[Pasted image 20240205140656.png|center|350]]

>Flexbox is a specific layout. therefore, its elements aren't layout following the normal layout style. Thus, a flex item or container won't behave like a block or inline block. 

>[!multi-column]
>
>Nesting multiple flex containers and items is the primary way to build up complex layouts; like the following layout that *only uses flexbox.*

![[Pasted image 20240205134756.png|center|300]]
### Flex container/item
>[!multi-column]
>
>There is a third type of box when I want to convert an item into a container (again, applying the `display: flex;` declaration to the item). This creates a `flex container/item` box that has unique behavior. Check [[22.7 The flexbox model#Flex container considerations|this header]] to know more details.

## How to enable the flexbox model

>[!multi-column]
>
>To enable the flexbox layout, one HTML element, the container one, must have the `display: flex;` declaration. Additionally, the explicit flex ruleset allows to mix and match this layout with other model (like floats, and grid).
>
>![[enabling-flexbox-dd3b59.cb39abcd.png|center|200]]


>[!warning] General considerations
>- `display: flex` declaration only turns into a flex container the selected HTML element and its first immediate flex item. 
>>[!example]-
>>![[Pasted image 20240209112256.png]]
>>
>>![[Pasted image 20240209112315.png]]
>>
>>![[Pasted image 20240209112325.png]]
>>- `display: flex;` is only present on the first container, thus, only this container is a flex container.
>>- Only the first immediate children is a flex item. BUT, the third container is NOT a flex item, is just a div! 
>
>- When a flex ruleset is given by a container, its items obey it, but the given ruleset DON'T overwrite any flex item intrinsic declarations, they belong to the container only. Also, the `display` and `justify-content` properties aren't inherited.
>>[!example]-
>>![[Pasted image 20240209102044.png]]
>>![[Pasted image 20240209102807.png]]
>>- The flex container has a ruleset that is being followed by its flex items, but detail the compile none of its declarations have been overwritten. 
>>- Compare both images, the declarations only belong to the flex container, not its items. 
>- The above behavior change a little bit for flex container/item. Check [[22.7 The flexbox model#Flex items|this header]] to know more details.  
>- Remember that containers, and, items and container/item have defualt properties that could change the behavior of the display of the container or its elements.  

## Content vs items; primary axis vs cross axis
>[!multi-column]
>
>In the flexbox layout, items are distributed along the primary axis, by default, lined up side-by-side, intersecting all of the children, something like this. 
>%% %%
>Therefore, a single item **can't** move along its axis. 
>
>![[souvlaki-labeled.webp]]
>%% %%
>![[Pasted image 20240215092741.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>
>Cross axis is quite different as it intersects only one of the children. Therefore, each item can move along its axis without interfering other items. 
>
>![[Pasted image 20240215092647.png|center|200]]

>[!info]
>![[Pasted image 20240215093106.png|center|300]]

>Thus, `justify-content` control the distribution of the group along the primary axis; and align-items position each item individually along the cross axis. 

>[!warning]- Why there isn't a `justify-self` or `justify-items`property?
>So, the reason why there isn't a justify-self is, in the primary axis, items get distributed as a whole group. 

## Hypothetical size
The hypothetical size It's the size an element _would_ be, in a perfect utopian world, with nothing getting in the way. However, it takes into account the content box, and the free space available. 

>[!example]
>The hypothetical size is affected by the default declaration `min-width: auto;`, the largest element within the content box, the `flex-basis`, and the width property.  

## Flex items
As soon as the `display: flex` declaration is active (and no other declaration is written) the width of the items will be `width: max-content` (this is, don't wrap by yourself and your width will be the largest word within you; so shrink yourself without any line breaks if you can fit within your container. If the flex item can't fit within its container, then line breaks, therefore, wrap is granted, see second image below), the flex items will arrange in a row and they will stretch to be as tall as the tallest item. If your flex container has a height set, then the items will stretch to that height, regardless of how much content is in the item (see third image). 

>[!info]
>![[Pasted image 20240213143441.png]]
>- Detail the flex items DON'T have a default value of `width: max-content;` but they behave as this declaration dicates, is an intrinsic behavior.
>- Also, detail the difference between min content, the element will find the largest word to define the width, and the rest will wrap it. Unlike max-content, the element will try to extend as much as possible. 
>
>![[Pasted image 20240213144145.png|center|250]]
>![[Pasted image 20240218135543.png|center|250]]
>- The reason the items become the same height is the initial value of `align-items: stretch;` Any other value will make the items height the same as the content box and the padding. 

>[!warning]
>If a flex item has a width declaration, it will take that as a hard constraint. The declaration is not affected directly by the flex-basis declaration or the content of the item; but it is by flex grow. 
>>[!example]-
>>![[Pasted image 20240215101849.png]]
>>When flex-grow is present, the width declaration get override by flex-basis.
>>![[Pasted image 20240215102017.png]]
>>![[Pasted image 20240215102029.png]]

>[!warning]

## Flex container considerations
### Initial values when a flex container is created
>[!info]-
>- Items display in a row (the `flex-direction` property's default is `row`).
>- The items start from the start edge of the main axis.
>- The items do not stretch on the main dimension but can shrink.
>- The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross-axis.
>- The `flex-basis` property is set to `auto`. This means that, in each case, it will be equal to the flex item `width` in horizontal writing mode, and the flex item `height` in vertical writing mode. If the corresponding `width`/`height` is also set to `auto`, the `flex-basis` content value is used instead.
>- The `flex-wrap`property is set to `nowrap`. This means that the flex items will always remain in a single row or column, overflowing their container if their combined `width`/`height` exceeds the containing element `width`/`height`.

The result of the initial values is that your items will all line up in a row, using the size of the content as their size in the main axis. If there are more items than can fit in the container, they will not wrap but will instead overflow. If some items are taller than others, all items will stretch along the full length of the cross-axis.
### Two containers for one group of objects
Sometimes is useful to group a subset of elements into a container and a flex/container box, thus, the the first box could have a defined width and be manipulable in terms of alignment and direction. And the inner, the flex/container box, has full control of the items.


>[!example]-
>>[!multi-column]
>>
>>![[Pasted image 20240205160958.png|center|200]]

>
>In this case, the internal flex container (dashed box) can take advantage, if required, of all the space given by the outer flex container (blue), but its items will remain 'contain' within the inner div. 
>
>If the inner div wasn't present, the flex items could still take advantage of the space given by the outer flex container, but the flex items won't be contain within a designed dashed box (that in this case has the same width as the red box) and vertical and horizontal alignment might be difficult. 
>![[Pasted image 20240205161855.png|center|400]]
>With both containers.
>![[Pasted image 20240205161929.png|center|400]]
>With one container only. 

### The minimum size (apply this to flex items, not containers)
The flexbox algorithm takes into consideration the minimum size declaration. Thus, The Flexbox algorithm refuses to shrink a child below its minimum size. The content will overflow rather than shrink further, _no matter how high we crank `flex-shrink`!

>[!example]
>![[Pasted image 20240215104044.png|center|200]]
>For an element containing text, the minimum width is the length of the _longest unbreakable string of characters._ Text inputs have a default minimum size of 170px-200px (it varies between browsers)

>>![[Pasted image 20240215104901.png]]
>>Here is `min-width: 0px;` and detail how the element shrink no matter the content, so use 0px is occasional, it shouldn't be a to go choice. 

Either for a container, item, container/item or HTML element, with this declaration `min-width: 0px;` they can shrink to 0px. 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240211211405.png]]
>In this case, the container and the container/item both have the declaration, therefore, they can shrink to 0px, regardless what is happening with the flex items (in this case they are overflowing).

>[!warning]- `min-width: 0px` won't prevent overflowing in all cases
>Setting `min-width: 0px;` to a flex item will make the item shrink to its largest part, but won't prevent any overflowing; regardless the container has a specific width. 
>![[Pasted image 20240212162247.png]]

>Remember, `min-width: auto;` means the box will shrink to not break the largest member within an element. 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240211211650.png|center]]
>Detail in this example, the second paragraph is not shrinking becuase the largest element is the first 'word'; thus, that word gives the box minimum width. 

When the element can shrink any more, it will overflow the viewport.

Flexbox is affected by the [[22.7 Outer and inner display types - block - inline#The standard box model - `box-sizing content-box`|standard box model]] by default, or the [[22.7 Outer and inner display types - block - inline#Alternate box model - `box-sizing border-box`|alternate box model]] (if the box-sizing property is change); this means, width/height values are fixed, no matter if the content is larger, etc. However, if no height provided, the container's height will be the same as the highest item or container's value. If no width is provided, the container's width, NOT ITS ITEMS, will extend to the viewport; response is active.

>[!important]
>Layout properties are added to the boxes' parents (flex containers) instead of directly to the box I want to align (flex item). Therefore, layout preferences are manage via parents, and not throughout  the boxes I want to layout. 
### Distributing multiple flex items
>[!multi-column]
>
>Flexbox becomes even more strength when the flex container has more than one flex item, in which values like `justify-content: space-around`, the space before and after the items is the same, BUT the space between items is not necesarily the same. `justify-content: space between` will distribute equally the free space between the elements, thus, the elements get pushed to the border of its container. 
>
![[Pasted image 20240205144316.png|center|350]]

Another property is `justify-content: space-evenly`, the space between the items and the edges of the container is going to be the same. 

>[!example]- Space evenly vs space around
>![[Pasted image 20240214123602.png]]
>![[Pasted image 20240214123622.png]]

>[!warning]- Flex declarations applies first than justify content

>- For stretch, the box for each item extends the full height of the flex container, regardless of how much content it contains. So, all the items will be the same height. 
### Align-self
Alignment also works at flex item level. Using `align-self` property override any `align-item` value given from a container. It accepts one additional value align-item doesn't have, and is auto, which will reset the value to that which is defined on the flex container.

>[!example]- Example of `align-self: auto;`
>![[Pasted image 20240215141115.png]]

>[!info]-
>There is no such thing as `justify-self`.

### Align-content, use case when using wrap
Now, what if I want to align all the rows themselves? I can use the `align-content` property. This works when the items are wrapped and I have two or more main ("horizontal") axis. 

For align-content to work, the container should have more height than its items, there should be free space. 

>The specification doesn't mention, but it has an additional value of 'space-evenly'.

>[!example]-

When the main axis change, detail how the alignment change based on the cross axis and primary axis. Justify and align properties work regardless the flex-direction. 
## Grouping elements
Flex containers only know how to position elements that are one level deep (i.e., their child elements). They don’t care one bit about what’s inside their flex items. Grouping is usually done using `div`. 

![[Pasted image 20240205151625.png|center|300]]
## Wrapping flex items
To apply this, use `flex-wrap` property. This will wrap the elements to its flex container height and width. First, the items will wrap, then the content of the items will wrap..

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240215110120.png]]
>All element wrapping possible has been done.
>![[Pasted image 20240215110228.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>

>%% %%
>Thus, `justify-content` works the same, but `align-items` changes a little
>
>![[multiple-souvlaki.webp|center|200]]


Now, align-items will affect flex items that are on the same columns. Like this, this is because now I have two main axis. 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240215110850.png|center|350]]
>![[Pasted image 20240215110904.png|center|350]]

>This means a `justify-content: center` in a row way, render items in a column using `flex-direction: column`.

The main axis is given by the `flex-direction` property, so, with a row value, the main axis is horizontal (from left-to-right) and with column value, the main axis is vertical (top-to-bottom).

>Remember there are two additional values, `row-reverse` and `column-reverse`.

## Flex-direction and flex-wrap short hand
The shorthand for those two properties is `flex-flow`, whin the first value is the direction and the second is the wrap. 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240218170843.png]]

## `gap` property
Add the specified space between the items only, and left free space if available. Similar to add margin. Also there is column-gap and row-gap.

>[!warning]

## Flex item order
>[!multi-column]
>
>The `order` property allow flex items to define its order in the flex container without affecting surrounding items. Every item is render in a numeric order, thus, when a order value is given, it will find in the appropriate order.

The default value in 0, and when an order number is given, the element will move to respect the order of all elements. Remember, in the first image, all the order values is zero of all elements; in the second all but the box 1 value are zero, the box 1 was the only changing from 0 to 3. 

>[!warning]
>Unlike setting `row-reverse` and `column-reverse`, that affects only single lines of render rows/columns, not all elements at once. The `order` property works with all elements and affect directly how all elements are render. 
## Flexible items space distribution
The `flex` property is a shorthand for three properties that affect how flex items size themselvves within their container, by filling the available space in the main dimension (principally horizontal direction), telling its container how to distribute extra space onto each item; either to growing or shrinking (the last one can prevent overflow). For example, an item with a `flex` value of `2` will grow twice as fast as items with the default value of `1`, like in the image

![[Pasted image 20240206164751.png|center|400]]

>[!warning] General considerations

>Now, the property `flex` is the shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`; When utilizing a number, this will only change `flex-grow`, for example, `flex: 3;` equates to: `flex-grow: 3`, `flex-shrink: 1`, `flex-basis: 0`.

### Flex shorhand and default values

>`flex` initial value is 0 1 auto. The item is sized according to its `width` and `height` properties. It shrinks to its minimum size to fit the container, but does not grow to absorb any extra free space in the flex container. Detail [[22.7 The flexbox model#^776861|this example]].

>`flex:auto;`, this is 1 1 auto. The item is sized according to its `width` and `height` properties, but grows to absorb any extra free space in the flex container, and shrinks to its minimum size to fit the container.

>`flex:none;`this is 0 0 auto. The item is sized according to its `width` and `height` properties. It is fully inflexible: it neither shrinks nor grows in relation to the flex container.

If flex has one value numeric value, it's assigned to flex-grow (flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: 0), if it has a width/height unit, it's assigned to flex-basis. If it has two, the first one is grow and the last one either shrink or basis.

[Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex) is a great example. 
### Flex-basis
It sets the hypothetical size of a flex item pegged to the primary axis (when the `flex-direction` change from row to column, flex basis will keep working) (check first example) (`flex-basis: 150px;` will make every item 150px, and grow and shrink will start from that value), so the `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` starts from the `flex-basis` value.  

The value respects the minimum content box element and the container width.

>[!example]-
>Here, the basis value is set to 500px but the content can't render that, thus, the item is shrinking. If flex-shrink is 0, overflow happen.
>![[Pasted image 20240218173001.png]]
>![[Pasted image 20240218173153.png]]
>Here it was set to zero, thus, the minimum content is respected. 

Using auto, the item will check for its width declaration, if there isn't, it will check the content's size (declared or not), and then shrinks or grow accordingly. Using a % will take into account the width of the container. 



>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240213170712.png]]
>Here, basis is 0, and even with a specified height when the content box is null (the fourth row), so the height declaration doesn't matter. 

>Give a specific width valut to basis is not common, so no flex-basis: 150px. 

>Another detail to notice: when we changed the flex-direction to `column`, `flex-basis` refers to `height` instead of `width`.

>[!warning] flex-basis auto vs 0, items of the same size
>With `flex-basis: 0;` the items will ignore its width and will grow or shrink evenly, thus will ended up with elements of the same size. Using `flex-basis: auto;` tells the item to check for a width declaration, if the item don't have a width declared.
>>[!example]-
>>>In this example, `flex: 1;` by doing this, all the flex items will have the same size.

>[!warning]

### Flex-grow
>[!multi-column]
>
>Flex-grow determines how much the flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items in the flex container when positive free space is distributed. When omitted, it is set to 1. ; thus, if one of three divs has been assigned with `flex: 2 1 0%;`, that single div will growth 2x the size of the others.

>[!info]- What the grow factor does in real?
>>[!summary]- In summary
>>![[Pasted image 20240215102758.png]]
>
>It depends of which widths have been specified:
>- If the flex items don't have a specified width, the grow factor will divide the container width in the total of grow parts, this is, the sum of all grow factors in the elements. For example, if the container width is 100px, I have three flex items each one with a grow of 1, the total factor will be 3, thus, each item will be having a width of 33.33; if one item has a growth factor of 4, then, the total will be 6, and each grow factor unit will have 16.6; therefore, the first and last element width will be 16.6, and the middle one 4 * 16.6 = 66.6.
>![[Pasted image 20240207115203.png]]
>- If the flex items and container have a width, the growth factor is going to take into account BOTH widths, and only the growth factor will be proportional. Is quite complicate to find the real growth number when both widths are specified.

>>Detail how the width of the container is defined and respected, and the growth value, the flexibility of the second items is 3 times of the first item. 
>- If the only the flex items have a width, the growth factor will take into consideration only that with. Again the calculations are difficult. But again, if the first element grows 2px, the second will grow 6px. 
>![[Pasted image 20240207122635.png]]

>[!warning]-
>
>- If the container doesn't have a width value, and the elements are set to grow, the container will occupied all the container available; this means, the viewport has responsive, the width of the elements will change dynamically.

>![[Pasted image 20240207092932.png]]
>- If the flex container has a specified width and the viewport is less than tat value, there is no responsive, the width of the container is respected, and the flex elements won't change it size, even a shrink value is present.

### Flex-shrink
Determines how much a flex item will shrink relative (in which ratio) to the rest of the flex items. Its initial value is 1. The property only gets applied if the size of **all** flex items is larger than their parent container. 

>If I do _not_ want an item to shrink then you can specify `flex-shrink: 0;` This could be useful to have a given width for an element that won't shrink, meanwhile the other items do.

>The default value of flex-shrink is 1 if not specified. Thus, even the shrink factor don't exists, the element will still shrink. 

>[!example]- No shrink factor with a flex container width set
>![[Pasted image 20240207091120.png]]
>- The size of the container is 250px, but the content overcomes it.
>- The shrink value of all elements is zero, therefore, no matter what, if the viewport changes or the container width is less than all the flex items width; all elements width is respected. 

>[!example]-
>In this example, there is no responsive because the width of the container is fixed. But the elements do shrink. Their initial width was set to 200px, but the factor made then shrink, ended up ay 158.67. 
>![[Pasted image 20240207095415.png]]

>[!example]- Useful to control which elements shrink or not.
>![[Pasted image 20240207095457.png]]
>In this example, there is responsive, of all the container (don't have a width), but the second element is not going to shrink no matter what. 

### Examples of shrink and grow
>[!example]- Width declared on content and item. Basis auto
>![[Pasted image 20240207145910.png]]

This can be used with images to conserve its aspect-ratio. 

>Remember that **only _one_ of these properties can be active at once.** If there's extra space, `flex-shrink` has no effect, since the items don't need to shrink. And if the children are too big for their container, `flex-grow` has no effect, because there's no extra space to divvy up.
### Static item widths
>[!multi-column]
>
>I can combine flexible width items with fixed-width ones. `flex: initial` falls back to the item's explicit `width` property.

>Thanks to this, only the flexible-width flex item gets resize when the viewport changes.

## Flex items and auto-margins
Auto-margins are use to avoid over use of `div`, specially when the div's only use is align items. Auto-margins help to align items to the left/right of a container. It **gobble up the extra space, and apply it to the element's margin.** It gives us precise control over where to distribute the extra space.

>Gobble up all the free space and distributed to the right and left margin.

>Gobble up all the free space and distributed to the right and left margin. 

The initial value is 0, but when it works when set to to auto. This property has to be set up into a flex item, no a container. 

>This is common to use in headers, when the logos or sign up information is on one side. 

## Block and inline flex containers
[question:: search more information about this]

Flexbox allows to explicitly control whether the container itself is displayed inline or block formatting using either `display: inline flex;` or `display: block flex;`
