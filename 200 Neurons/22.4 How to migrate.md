## How to migrate
With the schemas defined, execute `rake <name space>:<task>` following the image from the [[22.4 Rake|rake image]] to execute the migration will be `rake db:migrate`. 

The output in the console from the command is all the SQL queries that were executed.

When the command is executed, rake will automatically look for the directory specify in the task, and scan one by one all the files looking for up methods, to execute them one by one. 

>[!important]
>Rails keeps track of which migrations have been committed to the database and stores them in a neighboring table in that same database called schema_migrations.

## Migrates folder
It will contain all the migrations, it should be inside the db folder. 

## Data backups
Usually, when a migration is down-ed, a column gets deleted, thus, all its information is lost. So, in the code, above the `remove_column` statement I should write code to backup my data.
