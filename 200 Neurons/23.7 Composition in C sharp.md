Composition creates a relationship between two classes, or better, two objects of two classes. Thus, one class will have one field/property of another class.

When using composition, is a good practice to have the composed class inside of a folder called General.

The Domain folder refers to everything that has to do with the project. 

Then, created the derived class.

To use composition, just add a using statement, and create a property whose type is the derived class.
