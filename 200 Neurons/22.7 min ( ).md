[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

Useful to create responsive websites. 

>min() behaves as a boundary for the maximum allowed value, which in this example is 150px.

```CSS
#iconHolder {
  width: min(150px, 100%);
  height: min(150px, 100%);
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border: 6px solid blue;
}
```

In this example, if there are 150px available to the image, it will take up all 150px. If there are not 150px available, the image will switch to 100% of the parentâ€™s width.

>[!important] I can do basic math inside min ( )
>You are able to do basic math inside a min ( ) => for example: `width: min(80ch, 100vw - 2rem);`
