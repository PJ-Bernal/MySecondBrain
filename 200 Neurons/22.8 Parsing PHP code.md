[[12.8 PHP]]
## How is PHP parsed?
Any PHP code must be written between the `<?php some code here ?>` tags, when the PHP is being parsed, it'll search those tags. Doing this PHP code can be embed within any HTML code. Additionally, any PHP statement must end with a semicolon. 

>[!example]
>```php
><!-- Some HTML code -->
><p>Some text</p>
><?php echo "This is written in PHP"; ?>
><!-- Some HTML code -->
>```

>Everything outside of a pair of opening and closing tags is ignored by the PHP parser. But, everything inside a PHP block is take into account by the parser.
### Pure PHP files
When a file contains purely PHP code, the closing tag is redundant, so is better to not using it, as a whitespace o line break at the end can cause errors in the code.
