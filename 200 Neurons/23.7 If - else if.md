[[13.7 C Sharp|C#]]

Same syntax as always:
>[!blank-container|float-left]
>```c#
>if(some boolean expression)
>{
>
>}
>else 
>{
>
>}
>```


Remember, if the statement is a single line, the code can omit the curly braces. 

The else code block is not required. 


In C#, the if expression must result in a boolean expression, the compiler won't cast any value to a boolean [question:: verify if this is true].
