# About decorators
Decorators are a function that's applied to other code in the app. This are the same as C# attributes. They can be applied to classes, methods, properties, fields, getters, and setters. When applying a decorator, they can modify its behavior. 
# Decorating a method
Decorators are TS functions, whose first parameter is the method they will decorate, and the second is a `ClassMethodDecoratorContext` object that include useful information about how the decorator is being used.

The decorator will replace the base method with the original method. This new method first parameter is this that will refer the og function, the second is a rest parameter that will receive all parameter of the og function.

The new method implementation, first, call the of method and grabs its return value in a result. Then, it returns the of function return value.

Up to this point, the decorator does nothing, is the same as the og function.

Now, the decorator is affecting the behavior of the og function. Detail context has more properties about the og function, like kind and name.

To use a decorator add `@` after what ever I want to decorate, in this example a class method.
