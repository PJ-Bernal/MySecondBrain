[[12.12 React|React]]

## The React solution
The React Route library allow to specify components to be load based on the route. 

## Adding a router
Install router: `npm install react-router-dom`

Having this component:

```jsx
const Profile = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello from profile page!</h1>
      <p>So, how are you?</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Profile;
```

And this app:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello from the main page of the app!</h1>
      <p>Here are some examples of links to other pages</p>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="profile">Profile page</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

There are multiple ways to add routes, but after React v6.7.0 is better to add routes as objects. The following is the boilerplate of a react router in `main.jsx`:
### Routes


```jsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";
import Profile from "./Profile";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <App />,
  },
  {
    path: "profile",
    element: <Profile />,
  },
]);

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </StrictMode>
);
```

### The boilerplate
- Create browser root: create the configuration for a router by passing arguments in the form of an array of routes that contains objects with two mandatory keys, path and the element to be rendered.
- The configuration is rendered in by passing it to the `RouterProvider` component.

The first route is often the root route since all routes will render inside of it. All routes are objects passed to the router creation functions. 


## The link element
Use the `Link` element instead of the `<a href>` tag to enable client-side routing. Using the link will redirect the user to a whole new webpage, using client-side rendering, this not 

```jsx
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello from the main page of the app!</h1>
      <p>Here are some examples of links to other pages</p>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <Link to="profile">Profile page</Link>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Both `<a href=''>` and `<Link to='' />` perform GET requests, however:
>[!multi-column]
>
>>`<a href>`
>>- Cause a full page reload.
>>- Makes a new HTTP request to the server.
>
>>`<Link to>`
>>- Updates the URL without page reload.
>>- Handles client-side navigation.
>>- Doesn't make a server request.
