To create a button use the `button` element. There are three types of buttons defined by the `type` attribute:

1. Submit: use the `submit` value to create a button, when clicked, will submit the form to the url defined in the action attribute of the form element. The type attribute has a value of submit by **default**, i.e. if the type is not specified or the value provided is invalid.

>[!warning]
>There's an input type called submit that I can use to create a button that will submit the form. However, this is not desire as their styles doesn't inherit from the parent, causing problems when [[22.7 About styling forms#Fonts and text|styling text and fonts]].  

1. Reset: use the `reset` value, that resets all the data entered by the user, and sets all the inputs to their defaults. This button is not recommended to be used. 
2. Generic: use `button` value. This kind of button can be use for anything else, generally used with JS to create interactive UI. 

>[!important]
>The submit button will make a new request and submit data to the server. Hence, other buttons used in the page should have another type to avoid unwanted submit behaviors.

```HTML
  <button type="submit">Send your message</button>
```
