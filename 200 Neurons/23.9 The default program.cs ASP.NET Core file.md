# The default program class

This is the `program.cs` when using an empty template (detail is using top level statements).

Among other purposes, two main tasks are perform in this file, **register services and set the middleware pipeline**. 

The overall workflow of a program file is:
1. Create the builder.
2. Configure/add the services.
3. Build the application.
4. Configure the middleware.
5. Run the app.

## What Does WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args) Do?
Creates a `WebApplicationBuilder` instance use to configure services, logging, hosting, etc.

The instance is set into the `builder` variable to be used to sets up the hosting environment, configuration, and dependency injection (DI) container for the application.

```c#
builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();
builder.Logging.AddConsole();
if (builder.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    builder.Services.AddDeveloperExceptionPage();
}
```

## About app
The `Build()` method **finalizes** the configuration of the application and creates and instance of `WebApplication` (not `WebApplicationBuilder` like the builder variable) that represents the fully configured app ready to handle HTTP requests, taking all the services registered via the `builder.Services` collection.

`app` configure the middleware pipeline which determines how HTTP requests are processed. 

The `Run()` method starts the app and begins listening the HTTP requests.
