[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]
Match was introduced in PHP 8.; it uses a key/value pair syntax, where both the value or key can be any kind of simple or complex expression. 

>[!difference] Switch vs match
>The first difference with switch is that match is actually an expression, this is, it evaluates to a value, so it can be assigned to a variable.

Also detail the match expression don't use the `break` statement, so the value is return as soon as the key is found. And it can have multiple pairs associated to one value. 

The match expression **require** a default key/value pair, and all cases to be specified. If the key is not found, then an error will happen. I

Match does strict comparison, while switch does loose comparison.

Finally, when using switch, each case could have a full code block of many statements to execute; meanwhile with match, the value has to be an expression or, abstract a code block (for example a function) into a variable, and then call that variable of function as a value of the match expression.
