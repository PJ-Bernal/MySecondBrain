## Autoload vendor packages

In this case, the autoload file of the UUID vendor is like this. 
![[Pasted image 20240611130258.png]]

Now, to use the vendor package I need to require the composer autoload file in the main script. 

Then I can call a class and access a methods of the installed package, using the composer autoloader.

## Autoload namespaces
![[Pasted image 20240313114254.png]]
This error happens because composer know how to load classes from the vendor directory, but it doesn't know how to autoload our own classes from the app directory. 

To fix this I can tell the composer how to autoload my classes. So, go to the composer JSON file, and add an option `"autolaod"` within psr-4 I can to map my namespaces to the location of that namespace to the source folder.

To do this I have to define the autoloading rules under the `autoload` key. So the composer json might look like:

```json
{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "YourNamespace\\": "src/"
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- "psr-4" indicates that you're following PSR-4 autoloading standards.
- "YourNamespace\\" is the root namespace you want to autoload. The root namespace is `App` so I add `App\\`
- "src/" is the directory name where your PHP files for the given namespace are located (detial the first image of this note, the directory structure, app is where the script files are). Replace "src/" with the appropriate directory path relative to the root of your project.

Now, I'm having an error because composer autoload files need to be regenerated. 

Now, within the vendor directory, checking the composer_pst4 file, it contains the namespaces for my dependencies but it doesn't contain my own name which namespace which is app. 

![[Pasted image 20240313114003.png]] 

To fix that I have to regenerate that file using the command `composer dump-autoload` being within the container. Detail once the command gets executed, the namespace ('App') has been added, and it's mapped to '/app'.

Now, detail the script works perfectly fine.

>[!important]
>The mapping process of the namespace to the directory and the regeneration should have done only once, because PSR-4 will dynamically autoload it. So whenever I add a new class under the, in this case, the App namespace, PHP knows exactly where to look to load that. 

By using the composer I didn't have to use the `spl` custom autoloader function, and didn't have to include and require my class, the only thing I need to do is to include the autoload (`require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';`) file from the vendor in my index.php file.

### PSR4 considerations
The above is good for development, but in production I want things as fast as possible. So, Within the composer directory is a `autoload_classmap.php` file. 

![[Pasted image 20240611133603.png]]

PSR4 is already fast, but using class maps is even faster because dynamic autoloading (psr4) needs to check file system before resolving a class name. While class mapping will load the classes from a generated array. 

Now, within the docker container I can pass an argument to the composer dump autoload command to load the array with all my classes. The flag -o optimize the autoloading. 

![[Pasted image 20240506183057.png|center]]

After this, the autoload_classmap file might look like this, that are all the classes the application needs. 

![[Pasted image 20240506183151.png|center]]


If I want to add a new class I need to run again the command; detail this is not ideal for development because I don't want to run that command every single time a class is added. 

>[!important]
>If the class is not found in the autoload_classmap array, the composer will fall back to the autoload_psr4 file to load the class.
