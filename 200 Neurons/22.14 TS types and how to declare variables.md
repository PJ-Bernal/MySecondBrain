[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]
# What types are supported by TS
TS supports:
- All JS primitive data types: boolean, number, string, array. 
- Custom data types. enums, void, never (common in functions that throw something), any (useful when workng with 3rd party libraries) , null, undefined
- User define data types.

When declaring a variable with `let` the variable's type is going to be the set the value is representing. In this example, the type of test is all set of `number`

This means, the variable is pointing to the set of all numbers. 



# Declaring variables with const
In JS, const prevent a variable to be re-assigned, but it can mutate. In TS the variable also has a fixed set type given by the value the variable is assigned to.

The first image,`test` type don't represent the whole set of `number` but only `79`. 

The second image shows the variable can't be assigned to another type, even if its the same, but it can mutate.
