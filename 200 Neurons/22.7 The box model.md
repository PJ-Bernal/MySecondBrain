## What is the CSS box model
The CSS box model applies to block boxes and defines how the different part of a box (margin, border, padding and content) interacts to create the whole box. Inline boxes only uses a few parts of the box. 

[question:: which parts of the box does the inline boxes use to render themselves]

>[!info]
>There is an standard and alternate box model. By default, browsers use the standard model.
### Parts of the box
>[!multi-column]
>
>- Content box: where the content is displayed; use: `inline-size`, `block-size`, `width` or `height` to size.
>- Padding box: white space between the content and border; use `padding` to size. 
>
>- Border box: border that wraps the element; use `border` to size.
>- Margin: outermost layer that wraps the content, padding and border, as whitespace between the current box and other elements. Use `margin` to size.

## The standard box model - `box-sizing: content-box`
In the standard, the`inline-size` and `block-size` (or `width` and `height`), define the`inline-size` and `block-size` (or `width` and `height`) of the **content box**. Then, padding and border are added to get the total size of the box (margin is ignored to get the real size of the box). Check [this webpage](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/i/inline-size/#aa-why-cant-we-just-use-the-ol-trusty-width-property) or [this example](https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/RXLLyd) to see a use case to use `inline-size` instead of width.

## Alternate box model - `box-sizing: border-box`
Any given width is the visible width (content, padding and border) of the box; thus, the content box is that width minus padding and border.

>To turn on the alternative model for an element, set `box-sizing: border-box` on.

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240204214230.png]]
>- The total box size is 600 * 200, the margin is getting ignored.
>- The cascade applies and the width and height attributes are not taking into account.
>- The content box is 540 * 140, not the given inline and block size values.

>![[Pasted image 20240202091852.png]]
>This is a good example that CSS will sacrifice the element's content to match the padding and border values. This example also illustrates one thing is the element's box and other is it's content. 
>![[Pasted image 20240202091953.png]]

>[!warning]
>Utilizing the `border-box` value, CSS will match completely both padding and border values regardless they overcome the height and width values. CSS don't respect the content box value. 

>[question:: Which one is better or in which cases use `box-sizing: border box` or `box-sizing_ content-box`]
