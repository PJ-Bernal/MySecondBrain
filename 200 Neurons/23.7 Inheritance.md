# How to create a base and derived class
```c#
public class Employee {...}

public class Manager : Employee {...}
```

# About inheritance
All public members of the base class are inherited and can be use within the derived class implementation literally everywhere, in the derived class constructor, or even within methods, thus, the derived methods or the constructor can invoke parent's methods. 

Inheritance creates the [[23.1 Inheritance|is-a]] relationships. 

## Access modifiers in derived classes
Private members are not inherit by the class. But the protected access modifier make accessible members to the inherited class only; for non-inherited types, protected behaves as private. 

# Constructors of derived classes
If the parent class has a constructor with one argument or more, the derived class can use its own arguments and must call the constructor of the parent class, using the `base` keyword.

The base keyword creates a direct link to the parent class. It can be use with methods. For example, when overriding a method, this implementation will call the implementation of the parent class.

This is needed because when the derived class creates an instance, it should create an instance of the parent class. If the code creates a manager (derived class) this means is creating an employee (parent class). 

# Properties in the derived class
If the access modifier of the property signature is private, then, the property is not accessible to anyone. If the modifier is public, then, instances and derived classes have access.

Now, accessor methods **could** have (not required; if not present, then is public) modifiers, meaning, the code can make the getter public but a setter private or protected. In this case, to use a public/protected accessor, just use the upper case property name.

# About the is-a relatioship
Thanks to the is-a relationship, all derived classes types can be access through the parent class.

Though the second way is still valid, now the **type** of the instance is the type employee, the reference is pointing to a employee class. Therefore, members of the manager type are not available. 

```c#
Manager ana = new Manager("Ana", "Ramirez", "ana@gmail.com");

// This is also valid
Employee ana = new Manager("Ana", "Ramirez", "ana@gmail.com");

// Using a method of Manager cause an error
ana.AttendManagerMeeting(); 
```

Detail the variable is the type employee, but the instance is the type manager.

The above issue can be solve implementing [[23.7 Polymorphism|polymorphism]]. 

> What I understand to this point, is that, the declaration statement defined the type of the object, in this case, Manager. However, the type of the variable is defined by the type of the initialization. Therefore, the variable can access member that are present in the parent class, employee, but **can't** access members on the derived class.

[question:: what implication and use cases bring the use of saying the variale is type Employee but is using the manager constructor ]
