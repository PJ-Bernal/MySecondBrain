Same as with output, input can have the same media type, json in this example, but different types.

In this case, vendor types are also required, through the content type header, indicating specific media types. In this case, the type of the request body is being specified.

# Implementing 
The og code.

First, create a book for the second media type, type. Is almost the same, but this one uses the `bookForCreationWithAmountOfPages`.

Now, I have two actions that can be routed `/books` using the POST method. 

First, add the request header matches media type on each method, to different each post request by the value of the content type, and adjust the consumes attribute, also put a name to the 'main' post method.

Then, add a new class to the operation filters directory.

First, check the operation id if its not create book, do nothing.

Then, add one potential media type as content of the request body.

Then register the filter.

And finally ignore the remain post methods.

Now, detail the post is showing the correct media types.
