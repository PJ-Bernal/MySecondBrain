[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

The middleware approach is restrictive because the consumer can't access the any endpoints if its key is not verify. In this case, Authorize attributes don't function as expected. The docs are filters in asp.net core

# Creating a custom authorization filter
Add a new class that derived from attribute to annotate methods and classes with it; and the I authorization filter, and then add the implementation for the on authorization method.

Then create a method to validate the key. This is the same code use in the previous note for key validation. There's a slight change, it return false if the key is not in as a query string, it doesn't return a 401.  And at the end, if all checks out, return is whether or not the extracted API matches the API from the config.

Then implement.

Then apply the filter as an attribute on the method.

And remove the  middleware
