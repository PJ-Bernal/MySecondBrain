When applying the `ProducesResponseType` attribute, globally or not, the convention is ignored. Also, the conventions configuration is centralized, meaning one mistake can affect in several places of the API. 

According to MS, conventions are useful when controllers follow all a common pattern, and the produce response type attribute is not in use.

Meaning, is better to use attributes instead of conventions to be explicit, using API analyzers (don't rely only on that), and the `ProducesResponseType` attribute being specific where possible, and apply those attributes globally when possible through the Filters collection.
