## Loading images
Three ways to deal with local images:
1. Images files used inside my CSS with `url()`: the `css-loader` already handles that, nothing else to do.
2. Images files reference in our HTML template using `src` in a `img` tag: need to install and tell webpack to use `html-loader` which will detect image path in the HTML template and load the right image files for me. Install: `install --save-dev html-loader` and add the following to the `modules.rules` array within `webpack.config.js`:

```js
{
  test: /\.html$/i,
  loader: "html-loader",
}
```

3. Images use within JS files: for example when manipulating the DOM to create or edit and img element and set their src attribute, I need to import the images to the JS module. Images are not JS, therefore I need to teel webpack the images files will be assets adding the `assset/resource` module, without installing any dependencies; again, add the following to the `modules.rules` array within `webpack.config.js`:

```js
{
  test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
  type: "asset/resource",
}
```

Edit the test regex to remove or add file extensions as needed. 

Finally, import the image in the module like this:

```js
import odinImage from "./odin.png";
   
const image = document.createElement("img");
image.src = odinImage;

//same as creating an instance of the Image constructor
// const myImage = new Image ();
// myImage.src = odinImage;
// document.body.appendChild(myImage);
   
document.body.appendChild(image);
```

When importing, the variable `odinImage` contains the file path, Webpack recognize this import, when bundling into dist it'll have the correct file path. 

The bundled image's name after bundled, in dist, have a hash name, this is an expected behavior. 

>[!error]
>Writing something like `image.src = "./odin.png";` the file path will be an string, and when bundling into dist, Webpack won't recognize the string as a reference to an image file, so it won't include it into the bundle.
