# About enums

The custom type enumerators, allow to give a name to important int values to improve readability. C# store this value as a numeric value type. To create use the `enum` keyword, followed by the name, the content are strings. 

Useful when I want to have a word to classify things , for example, when cooking products have different weight units. Instead of memorize and using numeric values like 1 is unit, 2 is kilo; enums allow me to use the words directly. 

By default, C# assign numeric default values to each enum value starting from 0.

Enums are useful when important values are store as integers, for example, if an employee is 1, manager is 0, etc. With enums the code don't have to check the value, but work directly with a string that represents that value. 

In this case, using a string makes the code much more readable that using an integer value. 

# Creating an enum

Right click on the project -> add -> class. There isn't a template to create an enum, so use the class template. 

Within the enum declaration, the enum fields can have declaration statements whose default type will be the type int. 

If the type are different, change the enum signature: 
`enum Example: ushort {}`

# Using enums
Once defined the enum, use the strings as a variable within the code base.

The same applies when creating instance of the class, the code is not using an integer, but an enum, 'a string'.
