[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

If a child class has a constructor, it must call the `super()` method that will reference the parent class constructor; this must be done even if the parent doesn't have a hard-coded constructor. If the parent constructor has parameters, `super()` must include a value for those in the child class. Now, if the child don't have a constructor, but the parent does, the parameters expected by the parent would be passed when creating new instances of the child class.

This error happens because the child doesn't have a constructor, meaning, when creating an instance, the constructor called is the parent's class constructor.

I need to pass the title and year.

If the child class has a constructor, detail super also need two parameters. Now, the child constructor uses three parameters, also detail the parent super parameters and the child have the same name.

# Override methods
Just create a new implementation. I can use super to call the method implementation, but I don't have to, I can simply give a new implementation.

But in this example, the method is being called.

# Using protected fields
When a class extends to other class, private fields belongs only to the father class, so use protected to extend those fields as well.

Detail protected fields are not visible for child instances.
