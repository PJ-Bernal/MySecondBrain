# String are reference types
Strings are reference types and immutable, meaning, any attempt to modify a string creates a new string object in memory, this happens when using any string method. 

The second line makes b point to the same object in the heap as a, `Hello`. Then, because strings **are immutable**, a new reference is created, so a points to hello, and b to hello world.

# String builder
The string builder class allow to append and modify a string, without creating new references each time a string is modify. To do that, instantiate a string builder object, then append the require string and use `ToString()` method of the string class to obtain the string.

The first approach creates 10000 strings, the second maintains a string buffer that append strings.

```c#
// Using regular string concatenation
string result = "";
for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
{
    result += "brick";  // Creates a new string object each time
}

// Using StringBuilder
StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
{
    builder.Append("brick");  // Modifies the same buffer internally
}
string result = builder.ToString();
```
