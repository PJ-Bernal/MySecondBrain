[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

A literal is anything that represents a fixed value in the source code. The literal is the vale perse, is NOT the assignation to a variable. 

```ruby
'Hello, world!'          # string literal
375                      # integer literal
3.141528                 # float literal
true                     # boolean literal
{ 'a' => 1, 'b' => 2 }   # hash literal
[ 1, 2, 3 ]              # array literal
:sym                     # symbol literal
nil                      # nil literal
x = 3                    # this is a literal being assign to a variable
```
