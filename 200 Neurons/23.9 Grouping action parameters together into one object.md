When the implementation of the search/filtering grows bigger, several parameters can be used; the other notes only use two. 

Instead of changing the action method signature, the repository interface and its implementation, I can group all those parameters in one class. 

Create a new folder named resource parameters.

Then use that class as a parameter in the action method of the controller.

Then pass the parameter object into the get authors async. Update the interface and the implementation.

The og implementation

First, add the object as a parameter, and replace the hard-coded searching and filter parameters, with the object properties.

# Testing
A 415 could be when there no body and not content media type header.

Detail the 415, which is wrong. The api controller has its own internal implementation and set of rules for source parameter binding, hence, complex types are automatically assumed to be coming from the request body, and not a query string/parameter, like in this case.

In this case, author resource parameters is a complex type, but is not comming from the request body, but the query string parameters. So add the attribute.

Now it works.
