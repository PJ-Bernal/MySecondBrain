[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

In Ruby, variable scope is defined by a method definition or by a block

## Scope in method definition
Methods have self-contained scope outside the regular flow execution, only variables initialized within the method's body can be referenced or modified from within the method's body. Every method definition creates a local scope with new variables and objects. 

```ruby
name = 'Somebody Else' #This variable is in the outer scope 

def print_full_name(first_name, last_name)
  name = first_name + ' ' + last_name # A new variable initialized, with the same name, but is a new variable with a inner scope
  puts name
end

print_full_name 'Peter', 'Henry'   #=>Peter Henry
puts name                          #=>Somebody Else
```

Once the call stack returns to the main frame or to the 'main method' (the first method that invokes a second one), all the local scoped variables are gone. 

```ruby
some_var = 42

def foo(var_of_limited_scope)
   puts "#{var_of_limited_scope} is inside method foo. #{some_var} is not"
end

foo("test")
#=> NameError: undefined local variable or method `some_var'
```

## Scope in blocks
Block is the code between `{ }` or `do/end`, variables outside blocks (total) can be access and modified. However, variables initialized inside a block (number in this example), can't be accessed. 

```ruby
total = 0
[1, 2, 3].each do |number|
  total += number
end
puts total # 6
```

>Inner scope can access variables initialized in an outer scope, but not vice versa.

The value of a is re-assigned because the variable is available within the inner scope of the scope block. 

```ruby
a = 5             # variable is initialized in the outer scope
3.times do |n|    # method invocation with a block
  a = 3           # is a accessible here, in an inner scope?
end
puts a
# 3
```

>[!error] Not everything is a block
>The `do/end` used in a `for` or a `while` is not considered a block! The key to determine what is considered a block is seeing if the `{ }` or `do/end` immediately follows a method invocation. 

In this example a is accessible in the main script because the do/end are follow by a for, which is not a method invocation. 
```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3]

for i in arr do
  a = 5      # a is initialized here
end

puts a       # is it accessible here?
```
### Outer scope variables
In this example, b is a outer scope variable for the main script.

```ruby
a = 5

3.times do |n|    # method invocation with a block
  a = 3
  b = 5           # b is initialized in the inner scope
end

puts a
puts b            # is b accessible here, in the outer scope?
#=> test.rb:9:in `<main>': undefined local variable or method `b' for main (NameError)
```
