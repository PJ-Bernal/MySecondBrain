[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

A hash is a set of key-value pairs. They are represented with `{ }`. Usually, **keys are represented by a symbol**, that points (with  =>) to any type of data.

## Hashes vs arrays
The major difference with arrays is that array's keys are order zero-based index list, meanwhile keys in hashes can be anything and can be in any order. Also, arrays are ordered lists, meanwhile hashes elements can have any order.

## Create a hash
To create a has use `{ }`, then pair each key with its value using the => hash rocket operator. 
```ruby
irb :001 > {:dog => 'barks', :cat => 'meows', :pig => 'oinks'}
=> {:dog => 'barks', :cat => 'meows', :pig => 'oinks'}
```

Another way to create a has is using the `::new` hash class method. Using the hash rocker operator is an older way to create hashes. 

When using a string as a key, I'm force to use the hash rocker operator. 
### Symbols as hash keys
>Symbols are more performant and offer a cleaner syntax when creating hashes, over using strings as keys. I can merge the hash rocket and the colon, only when using symbols.

```ruby
# 'Rocket' syntax
american_cars = {
  :chevrolet => "Corvette",
  :ford => "Mustang",
  :dodge => "Ram"
}
# 'Symbols' syntax. Detail the merge of => with : to produce :
japanese_cars = {
  honda: "Accord",
  toyota: "Corolla",
  nissan: "Altima"
  # 'test': "this will produce a syntax error"
}
```

>[!important]
>Though in the last hash the symbols are `honda`, `toyota`. I can't use or call a key like that in a method or wherever I need the symbol. Therefore, I must always use the classic syntax `:honda`, `:toyota`. 

#### Symbols shorthand
When both the key and the value are symbols, I can wrote both as this. Detail here the key `key` and the value `value` are symbols. 

```ruby
test = {
  key: value,
}
```


## Accessing values
To access to an element, like in arrays use `[ ]` indicating the key name. Accessing a key that isn't within the array return nil. 

```ruby
irb :001 > hash = {:dog => 'barks', :cat => 'meows', :pig => 'oinks'}
hash[:cat]
=> "meows"
```

As in arrays, hashes can use the [[22.4 Arrays#fetch|fetch method]] to raise an error and return a default value if a key is not within the hash. 

```ruby
shoes = {
  "summer" => "sandals",
  "winter" => "boots"
}
shoes.fetch("hiking", "hiking boots") #=> "hiking boots"
```

## Adding and changing data
To add a key/value pair, use the syntax `hash_name[key/symbol] = value`. This will add the pair to the end of the hash. 

```ruby
shoes["fall"] = "sneakers"
```

To change a value just call the key:

```ruby
shoes["summer"] = "flip-flops"
```

## Removing data 
I can use the `.delete(key/symbol)` method that will return the value of the key that was removed.

```ruby
shoes.delete("summer")    #=> "flip-flops"
```

## Merging two hashes
Use the `.merge` method. The keys of the second hash will overwrite the keys of the first one.

```ruby
hash1 = { "a" => 100, "b" => 200 }
hash2 = { "b" => 254, "c" => 300 }
hash1.merge(hash2)      #=> { "a" => 100, "b" => 254, "c" => 300 }
```

This method has a mutator mutator version in which both hashes will be deleted to create a new one. 
## Methods
Hashes respond to many of the same methods as arrays do since they both employ Rubyâ€™s Enumerable module, but some have different behaviors for arrays and hashes. 

### keys, values
This methods return an array with all the keys and values of the hash.

```ruby
books = {
  "Infinite Jest" => "David Foster Wallace",
  "Into the Wild" => "Jon Krakauer"
}

books.keys      #=> ["Infinite Jest", "Into the Wild"]
books.values    #=> ["David Foster Wallace", "Jon Krakauer"]
```

Because the return value is an array. I can use an array method to print all the keys like `name_and_age.keys.each { |k| puts k }` 

### key?
Check if a hash contains a specific key, returns a boolean.

```ruby
irb :001 > name_and_age = { "Bob" => 42, "Steve" => 31, "Joe" => 19}
=> {"Bob"=>42, "Steve"=>31, "Joe"=>19}
irb :002 > name_and_age.key?("Steve")
=> true
irb :003 > name_and_age.key?("Larry")
=> false
```

### select
Same as array. Return any pair that evaluate to true based on the block condition.

```ruby
irb :004 > name_and_age.select { |k,v| k == "Bob" }
=> {"Bob"=>42}
irb :005 > name_and_age.select { |k,v| (k == "Bob") || (v == 19) }
=> {"Bob"=>42, "Joe"=>19}
```

### to_a
Returns an array version of the hash.

```ruby
irb :009 > name_and_age.to_a
=> [["Bob", 42], ["Steve", 31], ["Joe", 19]]
irb :010 > name_and_age
=> {"Bob"=>42, "Steve"=>31, "Joe"=>19}
```

## Iterate over hashes
I can iterate with the each method and use the pair. Detail, to do this with arrays I have to use the `each_with_index` iterator.

```ruby
person = {name: 'bob', height: '6 ft', weight: '160 lbs', hair: 'brown'}

person.each do |key, value|
  puts "Bob's #{key} is #{value}"
end
# Bob's name is bob
# Bob's height is 6 ft
# Bob's weight is 160 lbs
# Bob's hair is brown
```

## Hashes as optional parameters
I can use a hash as a method's optional parameter.

```ruby
def greeting(name, options = {})
  if options.empty?
    puts "Hi, my name is #{name}"
  else
    puts "Hi, my name is #{name} and I'm #{options[:age]}" +
         " years old and I live in #{options[:city]}."
  end
end

greeting("Bob")
greeting("Bob", {age: 62, city: "New York City"})
greeting("Bob", age: 62, city: "New York City")
```

I can also omit `{ }` when a hash is the last argument in a method call.
