## What is nvm?
The Node Version Manager (NVM) is an open source version manager for Node.js (Node). Works on sh or bash. NVM allows to easily install and manage different versions of Node and switch between them on a per-shell basis.

## How to install and check very instalation
[This](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) is the official repository, there I can find how to install and test if node is correctly installed. 

## How to install and use another node version
1. Install the desired node versions. `nvm install <node version>`. Be mindful the first version installed becomes the default. 
2. Execute `nvm use <node versio>` to use the desired version. This node versions must be installed prior to be used.
