Now, detail the version numbers of the library and the types are different. This is because declaration files are maintain by people.

NOTE that, in TS types matter, and TS is only able to work properly with a library when it has the declaration file. Meaning, in this case, I got this error. This means, TS is not able to find the declaration file.

Some libraries include the declaration file when installing, lodash don't, so I have to install it manually. 
`pnpm add @types/lodash`
