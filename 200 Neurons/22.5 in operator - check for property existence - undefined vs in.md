## Property existence test, 'in' operator
Accessing a non-existing property doesn't generate an error but return `undefined`. 

```javascript
let user = {};

alert( user.noSuchProperty === undefined ); // true
```

To verify if a property exists (regardless its value is defined or is null) within an object (function, direct or indirect instantated object), I can use the `in` special operator, the syntax is `key in object`, where key must be a property name.

```javascript
let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };

alert( "age" in user ); // true, user.age exists
alert( "blabla" in user ); // false, user.blabla doesn't exist
```

If we omit quotes, that means my code is going to refer to a variable that should contain the actual name to be tested. For instance:

```javascript
let user = { age: 30 };

let key = "age";
alert( key in user ); // true, property "age" exists
```

Detail `age` though is within the prototype, is not part of a property for the test1 function. 







```js
function test1 (name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.sayHi = function () {
        console.log(`Hi ${this.name}`);
    }
}

test1.prototype.age = 30;

console.log("age" in user1); // true
console.log("name" in user1); // true
console.log("age" in test1); // true
```
### Undefined vs in
Most of the time the comparison with undefined works fine. But there's a problem when an object property stores undefined:

```javascript
let obj = {
  test: undefined };

alert( obj.test ); // undefined, so - no such property?

alert( "test" in obj ); // true, the property does exist!
```

This could be confusing because the first alert is returning `undefined`, and I can think the property is missing but no, is there.

>However, this situation is rare as I should use null for unknown or empty values.
