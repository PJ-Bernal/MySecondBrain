# How to implement version routes
>[!blank-container|float-left]

The `[Route]` attribute itself will contain the version number.

Remember using `{}` in a route means whatâ€™s inside will be evaluated, in this case, the user version parameter, that will be compared to the supported API version. 

# Testing
The user now can type v1.0 or v0.1, v2, etc.  There's no need for the query string, remember the query string goes after the `?`.
