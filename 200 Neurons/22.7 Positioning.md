>Position properties allow to create more dynamic and asymmetrical layout, so they add an extra feature to the flex or grid layouts. 

## Static positioning
Static: is the default position (`position: static`) of **every element** and properties (top, right, bottom, left) don't affect element's position.

## Relative positioning
Relative: the above properties displace the element **relative to its normal position** in the flow of the document, also the elements is removed from the document flow. If no properties are used, the element's position will be the same as static. 

Two major things happen when using position relative:
1. Elements that use relative positioning can use the `z-index` property. Even I don't use this property, the relative element will appear on top of any statically positioned element.

2. Limits the scope of absolute positioned child elements, read above to understand more about this. 

## Absolute positioning
`position: absolute` allow to place an element at an exact point on the screen, without disturbing other elements around, thus, **the element is removed from the normal document flow** while being positioned relative to an ancestor element **that also have an absolute position** (see example). To put it in other words: elements that are removed from the normal flow of the document donâ€™t affect other elements and are also not affected by other elements.

It has specific use cases (in general, I want to stick something in a specific position without affecting the rest of the elements) like an image with a caption, icon used, etc. But must not be used to create layouts, use flexbox or grid for that.

>>[!important] Use case for `position: relative`
>>To fix the above I can apply the relative position to an element. And this is btw one use case of where to use the relative position, though that element won't be affected by any top, right, etc. Property.

## Fixed positioning
Fixed elements are also removed from the normal flow of the document and are positioned relative to the viewport. You basically use top, right, bottom, and left properties to position it, and it will stay there as the user scrolls. This is especially useful for things like navigation bars and floating chat buttons.

## Sticky positioning
Sticky elements will act like normal elements until you scroll past them, then they start behaving like fixed elements. Check [this example](https://codepen.io/theanam/pen/MPLBYy). 

## Use cases
[This article](https://www.kevinpowell.co/article/positition-fixed-vs-sticky/) explain where to use fixed or sticky, also detail the code pen is great.
