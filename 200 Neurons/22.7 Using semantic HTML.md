[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

To use semantic HTML think about  what your intent for users is and what context you want (or need) to provide to them. Checking:
1. If the user is **meant** to click something, use `<button>`. 
2. To provide tabular information, use `<table>`.
3. For `<inputs>`, always create a relation between the input and the `<label>` tag. 

```html
<!-- Useful when you need the input itself to have an ID -->
<label for='name'>Name</label>
<input type='text' id='name' />

<!-- Look, Ma, no ID! -->
<label>
  Name
  <input type='text' />
</label>
```

4. Always use the `type` attribute of the `input` element; [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types) is the list of all input types. In certain devices the input change the keyboard output.
5. To present a list, use `ul`, `ol` or `dl`, and their related `li` (for the first two), or `dt` and `dd`.
