## Creating a directory 
Use `mkdir` to create and `rmdir` to delete. The first argument is the directory name, the second is the permission and the third is whether I want to create directories recursively or not.

As soon as the script gets executed, the directory is created. 

This is to create directories recursively. Like, nesting folders.

To delete a nested directory I have to give the path to that directory, like `rmdir('foo/bar');`.
