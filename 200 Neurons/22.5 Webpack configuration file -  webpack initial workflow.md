[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

## Installing webpack
Having a [[22.5 package.json#Create a new `package.json`|package.json file]], execute: `npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli` to install and use Webpack.  

>[!important] 
>- Webpack is being installed as a [[22.5 package.json#^7557e5|--save-dev]] dependency. 
>- Delete the `main` property of the JSON file as entry points are define within the webpack configuration file. 
>- Add the `private: true` property to the JSON file when a project is not intended to be publish to npm (like most of webpack applications) or is still in development. 

>[!info]- This is how the package.json file should looks like
>```js
>{
>   "name": "webpack-demo",
>   "version": "1.0.0",
>   "description": "",
>  "private": true,
>   "scripts": {
>     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
>   },
>   "keywords": [],
>   "author": "",
>   "license": "MIT",
>   "devDependencies": {
>     "webpack": "^5.38.1",
>     "webpack-cli": "^4.7.2"
>   }
> }

## Webpack configuration file
Having created src and dist directories, and installed webpack, create the configuration file `webpack.config.js` in the root directory.

```js
// webpack.config.js
const path = require("path"); // Importing the path module from Node

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "main.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    clean: true,
  },
};
```

>[!important]
>The configuration file is use [[22.5 CommonJS|CJS]] instead of [[22.5 The problem with the global scope|ESM]]. This is because webpack and this file runs in NodeJS and not in the browser; Node uses CJS syntax by default and the file contains some CJS-specific things. 

### Inside of the webpack configuration file
- mode: the example uses development, but in production this field is different.
- entry: file path to the entry point.
- output: **object** containing information about the bundle. 
	- filename: name of my bundle file, can be anything.
	- `path` property: ensures the webpack outputs files to the correct location. 
		- `__dirname`: Node global variable that represents the directory of the webpack configuration file. If the project is in `/home/user/project`, then that's `__dirname`. 
		- `dist`: name of the output directory.
		- `path.resolve()`: creates an absolute path.
	- clean: if true, every time webpack runs it'll empty the output directory first before bundling the file into it. 

## Running webpack
Execute: `npx webpack`. This creates a the `dist` directory containing a `main.js` file. 

## The final webpack configuration file
```js
// webpack.config.js
const path = require("path");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "main.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    clean: true,
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./src/template.html",
    }),
  ],
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
      {
        test: /\.html$/i,
        loader: "html-loader",
      },
      {
        test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
        type: "asset/resource",
      },
    ],
  },
};

```
