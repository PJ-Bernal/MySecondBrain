# About stats codes
Status code are the only thing the consumer of the API will have to understand what happen with the request. For example, is a mistake to send an 500 internal server error when the client makes a mistake. 
## Common status codes
- Level 100 codes are informational, not commonly used for API. 
- Level 200 to indicate the requests went well. 200 for a successful request, 201 for a successful db resource, 204 for a request that shouldn't return anything (like a delete). 
- Level 300 use for redirection. 
- Level 400 to tell consumers they did something wrong. 400 the consumer send a bad request, 401 unauthorized, 403 forbidden the authentication succeeded but that user don't have access to the resource, 404 not found, 409 conflicts.
