[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

The action and method attributes tell PHP how to submit the data and where. In this case I want to send the data to a PHP file called formhandler.php inside the includes folder.

Post method when submit data, show something to the user inside a page, use get method.

To the other page to grab the data, all the different data or inputs should have a name attribute, that I'll grab once I send the data to the next page. For the first two inputs, the data grabbed is whatever the user typed, in the select, the data will be the value of the `value` attribute. 
## Submit a form and send data to the same file

Be careful because this is not secure.

## How to grab the data
1. Check if the user access in a proper way, not by typing a URL.

How to not let the user access the code, if they didn't access the file using the form. If is true, then I allow the code to run.

This is not a correct way to do this

The html special function convert data into html entities, to not inject code.

The header function is used to send back the user to the front page.
