[[12.8 PHP]]

## Comments
Use `//` for single line and `/* */` for multiple line comments. They don't take any processing power. 
### `?>` drop out of PHP into HTML
Comments in the same line as `?>` won't comment the closing tag and the following text (it will drop out the PHP code into HTML).

For the PHP parser, a block ends when the first `?>` is reached when commenting.

>[!multi-column]
>
>Detail how the comment stops at the first `;` leaving the ` ?> ' . "n" ?>` as HTML generating an error. 
>
>```PHP
><?php
  //$file_contents  = '<?php die(); ?>' . "\n";
?>
>```

>[!multi-column]
>
>To solve this use `/* */` even for single line comments or re-write the line as:
>

```PHP
<?php
  $file_contents  = '<' . '?php die(); ?' . '>' . "\n";
?>
<?php
    /* $file_contents  = '<?php die(); ?>' . "\n"; */
?>
```

>[!warning]
>Don't do nest comment, this will trigger an error. 
## Toggle blocks with comments
`/* */` overrides `//`, so I can flip two blocks just by deleting the first `/`.

>[!example]-
>First block toggle on.

>Second block toggle on.

## PHP within HTML comments
>[!multi-column]
>
>Once again, PHP parse will ignore everything is outside the opening and closing tags, thus, HTML comments don't have any effect.
