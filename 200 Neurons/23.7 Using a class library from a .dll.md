[[13.7 C Sharp|C#]]

Imagine having a library on a `.dll` file. To add the library to the project, right click on project -> add -> Project reference, this will create a reference to a local .dll.

In the new window, click brows tab, and add the .dll.  The added file will be within dependencies -> assemblies.

Double click the file in the solution explorer will open the object browser. 

Once there, call the namespace and use the class.
