# Decoupling the test from the repo
When testing something that needs a repository in order to work, I need to create a new repository to decouple the test from the call the repository makes to the db. 

For example, this method is using an `employee` that is created with the `_employeeFactory`. Additionally, the method is using the `_repository`.

The code base is using EF Core, meaning, the repo make calls to the db to gran entities. For that reason, the test must decouple this, creating its own repository without making calls to the db, but using some mock data.

>Creating a repo for a test is one approach, there are other like using EF core test, etc.

# Creating the repo for testing
Create a service directory within the test project and create a class for the repo test. 

The implementation is almost the same, but is using in-memory dataset, and not calling the db.
