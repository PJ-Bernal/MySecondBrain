[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

Development practice based on writing automated test before writing the code that is being tested. There are many testing tools (Mocha, Jasmine, Tape and Jest), all with very similar syntax and unique features. 

Writing test is more about why a text is written and what is going to be tested rather than how.
