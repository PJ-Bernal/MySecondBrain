[[13.7 C Sharp]]

# OOP and inheritance
Every type in C# derives from or extends a standard .NET type named `System.object` which provides a method named `GetType` to know a type of an object; then use the `FullName` property to access the property of the variable.

There are numerous mapping in C#, one is onto .NET BCL types. For example, all primitive types are directly mapped to .NET BLC standart types:

```
int[] (C#) -> System.Int32[] (.NET) 
string (C#) -> System.String (.NET)
```

All objects have a `BaseType` property that determines whether that types derives from or extends. Using this in a loop will return the inheritance tree.

# Built-in functions - functional programming
In C# executable expressions and functions are first class entities, thus, they can be treated like any other typed object (being reference by variables, or being used as function parameters, saved into a variable, etc.) 

This enables the functional programming paradigm allowing to create higher-order functions that takes other function as parameters.

The second aggregate parameter is an expression of the function the aggregate method will invoke for each element.

A single lambda statement don't require a return keyword. When the statement is complex (statement lambda), more than one, the compiler won't know which one to return, thus, the return keyword is required.
