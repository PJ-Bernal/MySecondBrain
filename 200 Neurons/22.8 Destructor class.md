[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

Destructor is a magic method like the constructor. This method is call (automatically, not by hard coding it) whenever there is no more reference available to the object (invoked before an object is deleted) or when the object is destroyed, or the script is stopped or exit().

The destructor method is so useful when I want the script do something when an object gets delete, for example, when a connection to the server is closed.

In this case the destructor is invoked first, because the object don't have any other reference besides when is instantiated. 

![[Pasted image 20240311111910.png|center]]

Here, the object when instantiated is "referencing" itself, then, on the var_dump is another reference to the object using `->` and after there is nothing, so the desctructor is called at the end.

Here the amount line code is not 'invoking' the destructor because it has a reference to the object, because the reference `$transaction->getAmount()` is available until the end of the script. 

![[Pasted image 20240312192424.png]]

Here the script was exited, but the destructor was called anyways.

## Destroy and object
Use the `unset()` function or set the value of the object to null. Detail I destroy the object, but the amount variable still exists.

## Use cases for the destructor function
Imagine the destructor as an action the script can do as soon as the object finishes what ever method or action is intended to; useful for:
1. Close connection with databases (if a database connection is open, is highly recommended to close it as soon as I done work with it, because if I have a long running script and I don't close the connection, it will remain open).
2. Clean up a class or a created object.
3. Release locks. 

>Destructors are not that often to be used. 

## `exit()` within a destructor method
Whenever that specific method runs, no other destruct methods will run on other classes. Using exit will still call the destructor.

## Example
![[Pasted image 20240312184055.png|center|350]]


```PHP
class File
{
	private $handle;
	private $filename;

	public function __construct($filename, $mode = 'r')
	{
		$this->filename = $filename;
		$this->handle = fopen($filename, $mode);
	}
	public function __destruct()
	{
		// close the filehandle
		if ($this->handle) {
			fclose($this->handle);
		}
	}
	public function read()
	{
		// read the file contents
		return fread($this->handle, filesize($this->filename));
	}
}
$f = new File('./test.txt');
echo $f->read();

```
