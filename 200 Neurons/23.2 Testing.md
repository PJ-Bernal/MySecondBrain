[[13.2 Project management]]

Testing is an important part of the development cycle though, as the invention of V-Model (testing usually confirms what the development team already knows) to try and help Waterfall (nobody notice wrong requirements until the end) indicates. 

Think about testing before you start developing, is the first step towards true Agile development.

BDD uses Gherkin a language to help users tell developers what the scenarios were using GWT, given (context, a current state of the business or starting place), when (a single action to be performed or a single action might be multiple actions behind-the-scenes), then (what the user expects). 

There are applications that will take scenarios written with GWT and automatically map them to automated coded test for developers.
