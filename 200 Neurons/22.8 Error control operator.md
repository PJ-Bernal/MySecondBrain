[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

## Error control operator
When adding the `@` operator it'll suppress any errors from the expression, and how it gets suppress is determine by how the error handling is configured in PHP. However its use is not recommended at all. 

```PHP
$x = file('foo.txt');// file don't exists, this triggers an error 
$x = @file('foo.txt');// this won't trigger an error in the browser
```
