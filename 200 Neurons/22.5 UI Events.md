[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

JS has a hierarchy of event types whose base is the `Event` object ([here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event#interfaces_based_on_event) is the full list). For example, the `UIEvent` object is focus on user interface interaction such as mouse movements, keyboard inputs, touch events and focus changes. Therefore, some sub-events of `UIEvenet` are `MouseEvent`, `TouchEvent`, etc.

Itâ€™s a good practice to use the specialized event constructor like `MouseEvent` instead of using the generic `Event` type because these constructors provide specific information and properties. 

For example, the `MouseEvent` event may have other properties that can be defined within its constructor.

```javascript
let clickEvent = new MouseEvent("click", {
    bubbles: true,
    cancelable: true,
    clientX: 150,
    clientY: 150
});
```
