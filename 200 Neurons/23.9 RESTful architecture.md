# About RESTful APIS
REST or Representational State Transfer is an architectural style for building distributed hypermedia systems. REST makes the server stateless, so it doesn't have to keep track of the client's state, instead is the API consumer that manages its own state based on the representation of the resource send by the server.

A REST API, is nothing but an API that adhere to constraints and guidelines of the REST architectural style. 

A REST response can be anything, JSON, XML, etc. In simple terms, a RESTful API is a way for two systems to communicate over the internet by sending and receiving data in a structured format.

Additionally, REST focuses on decoupling the user and the server. 

REST stops at the level of the outer facing contract with the consumer. What lies underneath is not imported to REST.
