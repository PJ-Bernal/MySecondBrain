# About RESTful APIS
Representation State Transfer is not a standard but an architectural style. The key is to understand the client changes state depending on the representation of the resource it accessing. REST doesn't have to use JSON as a response, it can returns XML if needed. 

In simple terms, a RESTful API is a way for two systems to communicate over the internet by sending and receiving data in a structured format (usually JSON or XML).

REST is about, among multiple things, a decoupling between the user and the server.
