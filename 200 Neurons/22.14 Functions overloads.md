# About overloads in TS
To implement function overloads in TS I need to provide multiple function signatures with one implementation that use type guards to determine which overload was called. 
# Creating the overload signatures
```ts
function GetTitles(author: string): string[];
function GetTitles(available: boolean): string[];
```

# The implementation 
The unique implementation signature must be compatible with all types specified in the overload signatures using `any`, and inside check the type of the parameters. 

```ts
function GetTitles(bookProperty: any): string[]
{
  if(typeof bookProperty == 'string')
  {
    // do something and return found titles
  }
  if(typeof bookProperty == 'boolean')
  {
    // do something and return found titles
  }
  
  return foundTitles; 
}
```

>[!important]
>When the overload signatures have a single parameter, I could implement a union type instead of providing two overload signatures.

### When the overload signatures have same and different parameters
In this example, the first parameter is required for both, so there's no need to use any, and the second is optional, so I can use `?` to let the implementation signature that's optional. This is a better approach than use `any`
