[[12.12 React|React]]

# What is JSX and why to use it 
ECMAScript extension based on XML to write declarative React code describing the interface I want to create. Is a prefer way to write react code over [[22.12 Creating a component from a root|this]] (where the code is still imperative). 

JSX code produce [[22.12 Creating a component from a root|the same react code]], however, JSX is highly declarative and easy to read. JSX allows to write HTML-like markup (that's not HTML directly) inside a JS file. Therefore, in JSX all the attributes use camelCase.

However, JSX enable to mix the rendering with the logic in a sample file, a component. 








# How JSX is transpiled
JSX needs to be transpiled to JS, depending on the bunlder they can use different tools;, for example, Vite uses `esbuild`.

Once this tool taranspile the code to JS, then the
