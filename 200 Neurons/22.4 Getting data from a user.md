>[!important] The IO class

I can use the `gets` method (stands for get string). When used, the program execution will stop and wait for the user to type and press enter. 

>[!info] chomp
By default `gets` **will return** `<whatever string I type>\n`, with the line break (by default). If I don't want this newline I can use the `.chomp` method.
