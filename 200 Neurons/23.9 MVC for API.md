MVC is a pattern that implements a view, a UI that respond to the model and controller. The view in API terminology, is how the data or resources are represented (usually JSON).

Thus, when a request is made by an API consumer, an action on the controller is trigger, that sends any inputted data (by the user) to the mode that returns a view. That view doesn't contain any Razor or logic, but a data/resource representation, usually a JSON. 

MVC encourages loose coupling and separation of concerns.
