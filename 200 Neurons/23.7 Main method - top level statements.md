# Top level statements
Since C# 9.0, top level statements simplifies the structure of the programs allowing to write code directly in the global scope, without declaring class or Main method. 

```c#
// Prior to C# 9.0

namespace MyProgram
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}

// Nowadays
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

Though the Main method is not visibly in the code, is still there. **The compiler** transform the top-level statements into a regular program with a class and Main method.

# Some restrictions
- Top-level statements in one file per project.
- They must come **before** any type or name space declarations in the file.

```c#
// This is correct - top-level statements come first
Console.WriteLine("Starting the application...");
var currentTime = DateTime.Now;
Console.WriteLine($"Current time: {currentTime}");

// After all top-level statements, we can declare our types
public class UserSettings
{
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public bool IsDarkMode { get; set; }
}
```

```c#
// This will cause an error - type declaration before top-level statements
public class UserSettings
{
    public string Username { get; set; }
}

// This will cause an error because it comes after a type declaration
Console.WriteLine("Starting the application..."); // Compilation error!
```

# A single entry point
C# has a single entry point which is the file containing the top-level statements. By convention this file is called `program.cs`. If any other file have top-level statements, the program won't compile.

Therefore, the other files would need to have a define namespace, and class:

```c#
// Program.cs - Entry point with top-level statements
using MyApp.Services;
using MyApp.Models;

var userService = new UserService();
var user = userService.GetCurrentUser();
Console.WriteLine($"Welcome, {user.Name}!");

// UserService.cs - Regular class file
namespace MyApp.Services
{
    public class UserService
    {
        public User GetCurrentUser() => new User { Name = "John" };
    }
}

// User.cs - Another regular class file
namespace MyApp.Models
{
    public class User
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
    }
}
```

This cause an error:

```c#
// File1.cs
Console.WriteLine("This is File 1");  // This could be the entry point

// File2.cs
Console.WriteLine("This is File 2");  // Compiler error! Only one file can have top-level statements
```


# Before C# 10.0
Prior to C#, this is what the entry point of the code looked like:
