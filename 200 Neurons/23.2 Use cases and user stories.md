[[13.2 Project management]]
## Use cases

Use case focus on the user only, with multiple ways of formality, but its bare minimum content is: 
- Title (what is the goal?) with an active verb describing the goal, short and simple. 
- Primary actor (who desires it?), not user because is required to identify exactly who (human or any external entity, other computer systems) is having the interaction. It could be an employee, user, administrator, developer, etc. 
- Success scenario (how is it accomplished?). Could be a single paragraph or individual steps, with no technical writing. 

>[!info] Extensions
>Use cases are typically written to describe successful situations. However, depending on the scenario, I can add extension which are alternate scenarios.

This is a typical use case scenario, if more details are required, use a full use case. However, this is to formal, detail and in some cases is not neccesary.

## Identify actors
Actors are people or external systems that interacts with the application. To identify them, think of the goal the actor wants to accomplish, and of course, the actors depends of the use case. 

When writing use cases, the primary actors are not necessarily the most important actor in the scenario, they are the one who initiated it. So, a use case could have multiple actors, primary, secondary or even third, actors. 

## Identifying scenarios
Scenarios are user-focus goals that can be accomplished in one encounter with the system (turn on the microwave is only a part of cook meal). When an scenario involve multiple encounters (feed the whole crew), is to broad; so focus on the user true goal of one encounter. 

Use cases could have multiple scenarios, but I should focus on the main successful scenario. There is no formality or implementation detail here, keep it simple. Also don't describe the GUI, don't say, user press the start button, just focus on the intention, the goal. 
## Diagram use cases
The use case diagram is not a diagram for a single use case, but for multiple uses and actors at the same time, showing its relation. In this diagram, every oval is a use case itself.

Arrows are not needed, is not about showing directions, but show which actor use which use case. Is common to put the primary actors on the left-hand side, and the secondary on the right. The diagram don't represent a specific sequence that the use cases need to be executed in; there is no order they need to be listed. 
## User stories
Describe a one single small scenario from a one single user perspective focusing on one single goal, what the user want to do and why, rather than focusing on the system. Is written in one, perhaps two sentences. User stories don't mention anything about any interface, implementation or technicalities. Alsso, it's discovered during the consultation process. User stories could be written by stakeholders, clients, managers, developers or the users themselves.

They follow the format: As a (type of user), I want (goal) and so that (reason)
