# See all the claims from within a token
The controller base class has a User object which type is claims principal that contains one or more claim identities.

With the api running, create a breakpoint in action method responsible for that.

In the watch window type User and see this.

The claims identity is constructed from the claims contained in the token automatically.

Reviewing `User.Claims` to review the token claims, see the user id, first name, last name, city and the other claims from the token.

# Using the claims
For example, only someone who lives in certain city is allowed to access poi in that city. 

This example will only modify one action method. The og code.

![[Pasted image 20250128102805.png]]

First, grab the city name accessing the token information through `User.claims`. This is not the best, is better to use something unique like an id. 

![[Pasted image 20250128102848.png]]

Then I need test whether the city name matches the city if from the URI; I need to work so add a method to the repo. 
Add the method to the interface

![[Pasted image 20250128103016.png]]

Then implemented using anyasync that will return T or F. 

![[Pasted image 20250128103034.png]]

Then execute the method in the controller. If the return value is false, then return Forbid() to return a 403 status code, meaning the user is authenticatedbut dont have access

# Testing
The city with id 1 is NY, but the token has the city antwerp. 
![[Pasted image 20250128103317.png]]

See a 403

![[Pasted image 20250128103350.png]]

Antwerp is 2, so change that in the uri and now works.
