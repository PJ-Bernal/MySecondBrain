When creating the course, the description could be empty. However, when using that in a website, the description must be there, hence, the course for update dto is required.

>This is a good reason for separating dtos for update and create

The og code

However, the update and creation are almost the same.

![[Pasted image 20250205105809.png]]

So, create an abstract base class for both DTOs.  Detail the abstract keyword because I don't that class to be used on its own, it must be derived from, the class will be use as a base class of other classes.

The virtual modifier is used when the base class has an implementation, allowing override when necessary in the child classes. If no override is provide the child class will use its father implementation.

Then include some implementation in the course for update dto, to implement the require only there. 
Validation annotations of the base class will still apply, but for course for update dto, the additionaal reuire anotation will apply as well.

# Testing
detail the title shoudl be fill and the desc is to large. Those two are annotations of the base class, for course for manipulation dto.

In this example, the require annotation is only applied at the level of the course for update dto.

![[Pasted image 20250205110902.png]] 

In this example, the rule from the base class (the title) and the course for update class are working.
