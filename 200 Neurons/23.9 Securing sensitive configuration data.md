Exposing or upload the connection string, the server name, a user name or password is a bad idea. 

The configuration and sensitive data must not be in appsettings.json, but in the development one. 

# Adding sensitive information to the development json
First, delete the hard-coded connection string in program, and add it to appsettings.development.json. while working in development.

And change it to this, to solve development issues.

When developing, the appsettings.devlopment.json file will be loaded. If in production, then the production one will be loaded. 

# Adding production variables
But for production, use a production environment variable or an Azure Key Vault. An environment variable is a variable whose value is set outside of the program, in theory, it will never be store in the source control system. 

Environment variables are defined by machine. In windows search edit system, then environment variables, then add a new system environment variable. The variable name is the key in the json, adn the value is the actual connection string.

VS loads the env variables on start. 

>Env variables override other configuration sources, the connection string will be used regardless of the environment choose in VS. Therefore, if Im developing, remove the env var from windows.
