# About the program.cs file
Every ASP.NET Core apps start and run like a console apps, meaning the `program.cs` file contains a main method that will **launch** the app, using top-level statements. The code in this file will run when the ASP.NET Core app starts. 

The code in this file will start the server to be able to listen to incoming requests, as well as code to configure the application.
