[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

There are two ways of version an specification, with grouping or simply version the specification like I version the API. Different api versions rely on differnt open api specification versions.

# Working with multiple open api specifications
In this example, one version of the specification require to group the author and the books resources in different books, but this is just an example, I group what ever I want. 
## Group resources
First, add a swagger doc for this new specification.

And another one for the other grouping.

Then add the middleware.

Finally, add the correct action methods to the right specification using the api explorer settings attribute. In this example, the authors is one specification, and books is the other one. OF course I can use that at action  method level.

Action methods that doesn't have the api explorer attribute, will end in both specifications.
