[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

Use to infer the type of a variable, property of expression. Useful when making API calls to define a type based on what the API returns. So, no matter what the response type is, I always want to create a type for that.

When hovering, VScode shows me the type of the variable is response, string, but within my code, I don't have a type for that, so I can define one using `typeof`

Typeof work with any kind of expression, even a class, or an instance of that class. In the first example I create a type that is a class.
