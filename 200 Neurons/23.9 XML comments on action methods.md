# Adding code comments
Use XML, adding `///` to comment code is a standard practice. This could be done to document properties, fields, methods, etc.

Also detail returns comments can be more professional.

To add comments to the return type of the endpoints (in the schema section of the swagger UI), the specification refers to the model, not the endpoints, meaning, comments need to be added onto the class models.

# Generate XML documentation
After generating the code documents, open the project properties -> build -> Output, then check documentation file. This will generate XML documentation in the specific location. 

The name of the XML documentation needs to match the name of the application assembly.

# Configuring addSwaggerGen
## Adding XML comments to the documentation
To indicate, configure the `AddSwaggerGen`:
- `xmlCommentsFile`: the name can be hardcoded, but is better to use reflection becase the name matches the assembly name without dll extension.
- `xmlCommentsFullPath`: indicate where the path resides, and the second parameter is where the path lives.
- `IncludeXmlComments`: tell swashbuckler to use that file to generate the documentation.

The below is another way to achieve the same thing:

Now, the Swagger Ui documentation has all the XML comments added. Action methods and DTOs.

The `GetCities` action method returns an `IActionResult`, it can return 400, 404, and 200, but the documentation is showing only a single response type.  ^b77471
