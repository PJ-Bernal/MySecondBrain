# Adding code comments
Use XML, adding `///` to comment code is a standard practice. This could be done to document properties, fields, methods, etc.

Remarks provides an example of how to send a request and what to expect

# Generate XML documentation
After generating the code documents, open the project properties -> buid -> Output, then check documentation file. This will generate XML documentation in the specific location.

# Configuring addSwaggerGen
## Adding XML comments to the documentation
To indicate, configure the `AddSwaggerGen`:
- `xmlCommentsFile`: the name can be hardcoded, but is better to use reflection becase the name matches the assembly name without dll extension.
- `xmlCommentsFullPath`: indicate where the path resides, and the second parameter is where the path lives.
- `IncludeXmlComments`: tell swashbuckler to use that file to generate the documentation.

The below is another way to achieve the same thing:

Now, the Swagger Ui documentation has all the XML comments added. Action methods and DTOs.

Detail this is how a remark is detail in swagger.

The `GetCities` action method returns an `IActionResult`, it can return 400, 404, and 200, but the documentation is showing only a single response type. 




## Configure the document generation process
Use `option.SwaggerDoc(<version number>, <OpenAPI information>)`.

This is without the above config.

With the above.
