[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

TS has interfaces to detect which kind of element is being created and type according to that.

When TS is not able to identify the element, like when selecting an element by its id or class, TS will infer its type as Element.

However, is better to type cast because I know which element is, in this case is a div.

Is better to use a generic.
