# Creating the service
Add a services folder and a class; this class mimic sending an email through the console.

# Adding the service

Because there's no interface, detail the service is being directly registered in the service container. 

Once registered, then inject the dependency with the constructor injection in the constructor of the controller that will be using the service.


When injecting a service that is not in the container, the injection will fail **only** when using the default DI container. If the app is using another container, the app might be able to respond in a unexpected way; that's why is better to add the null exception check.  

(localMailService is the missing part)

Then, I can use the instance in what ever action method. In this case, the instance is being use in the delete point of interest action method.
