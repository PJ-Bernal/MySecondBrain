[[13.1 OO Programming|OOP]]

The fundamental unit in a OO design is the class, and the desired result is a robust and functional object model. Designing a OO solution is about being creative over finding the best design the first time; OO design is an iterative process, so not having a perfect design the first try is okey.  brainstorm, don't try to conform to any standard or convention.  ^18f3bf

>In fact, at the start of the process, don’t even begin to consider a specific programming language. The first order of business is to identify and solve business problems. Work on the conceptual analysis and design first. Think about specific technologies only when they are fundamental to the business problem. For example, you can’t design a wireless network without wireless technology.

Prior to learning an OO language, learning the concepts and the thought process should come first; if not, the project won't truly be OO.
