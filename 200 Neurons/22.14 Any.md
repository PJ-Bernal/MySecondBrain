When the inference mechanism can't be used, like in these 4 cases, the value type will be `any`.

This indicates TS to ignore completely the strong and static TS check, the infer mechanism is deactivated.

`any` can also be assigned as the type of a variable.



Because the type checking (the strong and static checks) is ignored, when using dot notation to access properties/values, VSCode won't pop-up any window. 

>[!important]
>The above means TS literally doesn't know the value type of a variable, therefore, it doesn't know what are the properties/methods of the object, therefore, TS **won't report as an error** calling a wrong or unknown property/method of an object whose type is any, though is clearly an error. Check the below example.

TS is saying "I don't know what you type is, so you can call whatever property/method you want".

>[!error] Don't use any that often
>Because of the above behavior, try to avoid the use of any, and be mindful about the four cases any is 'implemented' by TS by default. Don't use it as default variable type, when the type is known or undefined. 

## When to use any
-  When the data structure is not know at compile time, such as user input or AI response. 
- Libraries that donâ€™t have TS declarations, any might be necessary
- In strange cases I might need to override a TS type 
- Is better to use unknown for values of unknown type
