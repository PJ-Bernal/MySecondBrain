## Make persistent the `to` of keyframes

By default, when an animation is over, the element will be restored to its animation stage "original" configuration. In this example the box is visible, then immediately starts fading to opacity 0, and when the animation finish it pops back into a regular element. The graphic shows how the opacity change over time.

```css
 @keyframes fade-out {
    from {
      opacity: 1;
    }
    to {
      opacity: 0;
    }
  }
  
  .box {
    animation: fade-out 1000ms;
  }
```

>This happens because the `from` and `to` blocks **only apply** while the animation is running.

### How to solve this
1. Set the final state of the element within the animation stage. The initial state is configure within `from`. Detail `to` and the animation stage styles properties are the same. 

```css
@keyframes fade-out {
    from {
      opacity: 1;
    }
    to {
      opacity: 0;
    }
  }
  
  .box {
    animation: fade-out 1000ms;
    /*
      Change the "default" value for opacity,
      so that it reverts to 0 when the
      animation completes.
    */
    opacity: 0.5;
  }
```

2. Use the `animation-fill-mode`, check [[22.7 Animation stage - keyframes#^bbf74d|this property]], to make persistent the end stage.

```css
@keyframes fade-out {
    from {
      opacity: 1;
    }
    to {
      opacity: 0;
    }
  }
  
  .box {
    animation: fade-out 1000ms;
    animation-fill-mode: both;
  }
```
>[!blank-container|float-left|medium]

When the animation ends, animation-fill-mode: forwards will copy/paste the declarations in the final block, persisting them forwards in time.






## Filling backwards - make persistent `from`
>[!blank-container|float-left]

A delayed animation won't remove the element from the flow, making the animation weird in some cases, for example, when I want the element appear suddenly.



```css
@keyframes slide-in {
    from {
      transform: translateX(-100%);
      opacity: 0.25;
    }
    to {
      transform: translateX(0%);
      opacity: 1;
    }
  }

  .box {
    animation: slide-in 1000ms;
    animation-delay: 5000ms;
  }
```

>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20241008145005.png|350]]

In this example, the animation has some delay, thus, the element sit there for a second, and the animates. 

To solve this, use the `animation-fill-mode: backwards`, to make persistent the `from` of the keyframes, during the animation stage. 
>[!blank-container|float-right]
>![[Pasted image 20241008145248.png|350]]







```css
@keyframes slide-in {
    from {
      transform: translateX(-100%);
      opacity: 0.25;
    }
    to {
      transform: translateX(0%);
      opacity: 1;
    }
  }

  .box {
    animation: slide-in 1000ms;
    animation-delay: 500ms;
    animation-fill-mode: backwards;
  }
```

## Make persistent both 
In this case use `animation-fill-mode: backwards;` it will make persistent the animation stage and the to from keyframes. This could cause bugs.
