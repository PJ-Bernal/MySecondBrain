[[13.2 Project management]]

DDD was develop before agile and microservices (DDD is an ideal way to design this) existed.

## What is DDD?
1. Is a collaborative process. Means it works perfect with an agile methodology as their philosophies are similar. 
2. DDD is build on the notion of modeling. 
	1. The structure of the code should model or map to the structure of the domain (anything to make sense to business users) within which the problem is being solved. 
	2. The business user and all collaborators should be able to look at the overall large structure of the system and make sense of it.  
	3. Changes are made to the domain, which maps to where code change should occur. It's easy to make changes. Changes happen in the domain, not in the code; therfore, I need to quickly get the equivalent change in the code. So when the domain change I knoiw exactly where to look in the code to make that change. 
3. Incremenetal. No big architecture is required before coding. Instead, I just come up with just enough architecture to solve the immediate problem. As I implementat that, I learn more about the problem and the code evolves, and more architecture is added. Maybe at some point the architecture should change in order to accomodate whatever new things I learn from the problem as the code evolves.  

DDD design architecture will allow my code to grow incrementally over time becuase the architecture itself grows incrementally. And this workds, because the domain itself provides an architectural coherence that I wouldn't have if I look at things like the hardware. Thus, DDD tends to lead to an incremental develpoment. 

[question:: what is DDD. What is a domain. what does it mean to have changes in the domain but not in the code]
[question:: search for a course of ddd]

The domain is going to influence the system, but we also tend to see this as a linear process, when is not. The domain influence the system, and viceversa.

This means DDD is desing for a world in which I'm releasing incrementally. Every time I release into the actual domain, user will use that code, and tht will change the domain to somme extent.  (I create a little bit of code, released it to the users, the user start using it, change it they way it work). 

## How DDD fit with agile?
DDD being a collaborative process, allign with the collaborative principle of the Agile manifesto; this means I can't do DDD desing if I don't have business people in the room (usually they will collaborate more than techical people, as the structure of the domain is the structure of the code, the business person's notion of the way the domain works, is telling me exactly how the code has to work).  
### Inspect and adatp loop
1. Make a small change and release it.
2. Assess (feedback).
3. Improve based on feedback. 

This is really Agile. To be agile, get small increments into the user's hands as quickly as possible. 

## Agile story
To have something valuable to release to the users, and keep the system stable, I should have, what is called in agile, a story. One of the goals of stories is to find what is a valuable result for the users. So, implement that story is directly implement something useful for the user.
