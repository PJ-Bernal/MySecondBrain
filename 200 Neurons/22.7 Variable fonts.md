[[12.7 HTML and CSS]]
## What is it purpose
Instead of having separate files for regular, bold, extra bold, and so on, a variable font file is responsive. It contains all the information it needs to be displayed across a spectrum of weights or styles.

- Provide variable fonts. [question:: Search more information about use-cases of variable fonts]
- With only one link ref embed of the font I have multiple types of the same font, so I don't have to embed multiple fonts within the HTML. 
- Allow to create cool transitions of the font-weight. When the font is hover, it'll reach a font-weight of 700.
