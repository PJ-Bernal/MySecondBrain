[[12.10 Docker|Docker]]

A Docker container bundles up the application with all its dependencies and its configuration. I can have all the dependencies installed under one container or have multiple container for those dependencies.

## What is a docker container and a image?
Its a simple vanilla Linux machine that don't have anything install for the application. Then, to tell the container what needs to be installed I need to use a `Dockerfile`; which is a text file where I write instructions on how to build a docker image.

So a container is like a runtime instance of an image that can be modified. This container are stored in repositories, liker Docker Hub. And I can pull those images from the repository and use them to build my containers in local staging or production. Container executed in isolated enviroments.

## Docker's benefits
- Containers are isolated from each other, and I can decided the granularity of each container, meaning, one container can have only one dependency, or four, or ten if I like. 
- I can execute several versions of the same dependencies without additional configurations.
- CLI ease containers and image creations. 
- Is OS agnostic. 
- Each container has all that the dependency requires to work correctly.
