## What is a request/response?
It happens when the <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">browser</mark> <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">send</mark> some text to an IP address (by clicking a link, log in into a webpage, type a website dns, with a method, etc.);  the <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">server</mark> dissemble it, understand its components and <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">send a response back</mark> with any <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">resource</mark> (video, images, HTML or CSS sheets, etc.) for the browser to process it. 

Every request gets a response, even if the response is an error (or time out).  

>Browsers interpret the HTTP responses (redirect the client, update the website, etc. Thus it hides a lot of the underlaying request/response cycle), unlike Linux that only receives and shows the raw response. 

>[!quote]- If I want to be a developer
>I'll need to learn to read and process raw HTTP response data just by scanning it. Of course, you won't be able to convert it into a high-resolution picture in your head, but you should have a general idea of what the response is about. With enough experience, you can dig into the raw data and do some debugging and see exactly what's in the response.

## Seeing a request with the browser inspector
With almost any browser inspector the request/response can be analyzed under the <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">`Network` tab</mark>. <mark style="background: #00FF0F3B;">Every row</mark> in the table represents a <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">request</mark> by the browser to the server (visiting one URL generates multiple requests), one for every resource (images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.). 

### Network tab

For now, the first request is commonly the host ([[22.2 What is a URL#^e66d7e|See host]]), an HTML document (see 'type: HTML' in the image), follow by different requests. Detail the different HTTP protocols used, the method, status, type, etc.

Clicking on one entry shows new tabs: headers (request and response headers[^1], cookies, request, etc. Firefox allows to see the real raw response (or labeled version) of every request or response.

#### Responses/requests examples
The `Response` tab contains exclusively the resource contain in the server response. Here are some examples of the 'response resources'.

- The very first request gets a HTML response that is the page itself.

Notice two things. First, the <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">second request</mark> listed (an JS script whose domain is `https://d24f1whwu8r3u4.cloudfront.net`,) <mark style="background: #D23D3D78;">correspond to the first script the HTML response sheet </mark>request to the server. Second, the 'not-raw' response of the first request is the page itself.[^2]

- JS scripts.

- "Null" response (not getting a resource, is a type of response).

- Images.

## Why so many responses are send back to the browser?
>The initial resource requested, `launchschool.com` returned an HTML whose body references other resources the browser translates in new requests. 

An HTTP tool or Linux won't break in tabs the response as the browser does but give a massive chunk of the whole response. 
## Seeing a raw request with Linux 
`$ curl -X GET "https://www.launchschool.com/" -m 30 -v` This line gets me the first response containing more information and the same HTML as [[22.2 HTTP requests#^e24e06|this example.]] ^bfe81b

[^1] [question:: What is a request header in HTTP]
[^2][question:: The first request, receive a response that is an HTML, but this HTML is the page itself, so, this means the other request 'feed' the main request but this request is like the skeleton or container of the page itself?]
