[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]
## Variable declaration
All variables must be declare with `$` follow by the variable name: `$variable`. A variable must start with a letter or underscore, with no special character or called `$this`; and names are case sensitive.
## No datatypes
In PHP variables are assigned by value, not by type. Detail no data types were typed, no `int`, `float`, etc. 

```PHP
$name = 'John';
$address = 123;
echo $name; // John
```

>$x = 1;
>$y = x;
>$x = 3;
>echo $y; // 1
>$y = &$x;
>echo $y; // 3
