[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

The following are the most commonly used properties and methods of instances of the `Event` object. 

![[Pasted image 20240326120947.png]]

>[!important]
>- Note that the event object is only accessible inside the event handler. (meaning, only the parameter inside of the arrow function of the event listener is consider an `Event` instance). Once all the event handlers have been executed, the event object is automatically destroyed.


- `preventDefault()` method does not stop the event from bubbling up the DOM.

```html
<a href="https://www.javascripttutorial.net/">JS Tutorial</a>
```

```js
let link = document.querySelector('a');

link.addEventListener('click',function(event) {
    console.log('clicked');
    event.preventDefault();
});

// clicked
// The link doesn't open
```


- `stopsPropagation()` method immediately stops the flow of THE SAME event through the DOM tree. However, it does not stop the browserâ€™s default behavior. 

```html
<button id="btn">CLICK ME BABY</button>
```

```js
btn.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    console.log('The button was clicked!');
    event.stopPropagation();
});

document.body.addEventListener('click',function(event) {
    console.log('The body was clicked!');
});

//The button was clicked
```


In this example, the click event never reaches the body becuase of the stop propagation. 
```js
btn.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    console.log('The button was clicked!');
});

document.body.addEventListener('click',function(event) {
    console.log('The body was clicked!');
});

//The button was clicked
//The body was clicked
```

## Obtaining more information about the event
With all three methods I can obtain more information using a callback anonymous function.

In this example, I'm using the third method to obtain information about the event. 

```javascript
btn.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  console.log(e);
});
```

>[!important]
>The parameter of the anonymous function contains an object that references the event itself. Within that object you have access to many useful properties and methods (functions that live inside an object).

For example, the property `target`:

```javascript
btn.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  console.log(e.target);
});
```

```javascript
btn.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  e.target.style.background = "blue";
});
```
