# About the media type
The contract consist of:
- URI: where the resource can be found.
- HTTP method. 
- Payload: optional. When creating or requesting a resource, the HTTP request and response, respectively, will have to contain a representation the resource describing its format with the `media-type` header, for example: `media-type: application/json`.

>However, `application/json` inform about the format and not the type of the data.

# HATEOAS and content negotiation

Making a request after implementing HATEOAS, will result in a response body with two fields: value and links.

The request body of this response is an `application/json`; however, the response is a representation of the authors with additional semantics (the links), on top of the json representation. 

Hence, the links shouldn't be part of the resource when the request is requesting `application/json`.  In reality, this response (json + links) is a complete new media type. 

This breaks the seld-descriptive message sub constrain, because each message don't include enough information to know how to be process. Returning a representation with links when the accept header is `application/json`, the wrong representation is being send and the consumer don't know how to interpret the response. 

The consumer know in reality, the representation is a json, but doesn't know about the extra semantics added.
## Creating a new media type
The solution for this is creating a new media type, a vendor specific media type: `application/vnd.marvin.heateoas+json`. In this new media type, the links and the json can be together.

Another example could be:
`application/vnd.pablo.hateoas+json`

`vnd` is a prefix used in custom media types to indicate the media type is specific to a particular vendor. 


The consumer must be aware of the vendor media type and should know how to process it.
