## dbh file
Create one folder called includes (contain non-related user files, like php files) with one file name `dbh.inc.php` that stands for database handler (other naming convention is `dbhinc.php` or `dbh-inc.php`). 

The first line of this document is the DSN or data source name that tells the server what kind of database driver the host, then name of the database, etc.

### dns parameters
The list of parameters of the dsn variable are:
- `mysql`: refers to which driver, what database I'm makin the connection. 
- `host=host name` the name of the host. 
- `dbname` name of the database.

I might end with something like this: `$dsn = "mysql:host=localhost;dbname=recipedb";`
### db username and password
Required parameters with default values assigned to variables.

```PHP
$dbusername = "root";
$dbpassword = "";
```
### `try` and `catch`
There are two ways to connect to a database, either use MySQLi or use PDO (PHP data object). The first step is to create a PDO object with a constructor whose arguments are the dsn variable, db user name and password. That object is enough to connect the database, but is secure to have a try catch with more information in case an error happens.

In this case, I want to change some properties of this object by grabbing an object method using `->`. What that line code says is, if an error happens the script will throw and exception. 

So the catch parameter is that exception that is assigned to a variable (named e in this example).
