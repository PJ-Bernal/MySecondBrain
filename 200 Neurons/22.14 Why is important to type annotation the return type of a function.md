In TS, when a function is meant to perform side effects and all code branches don't have **any** return statement, TS will infer the functions' return type as `void`.

But in TS, when a function has branches, the return type will be the union of those branches' types; in this example, `number` and `undefined`. Detail the compiler is able to infer in some way the function's return value type, however, is not able to infer the parameter's type, meaning, it will assign `any` to all un-annotate parameters. 

The above inference could be misleading, therefore, is useful to always type the function's return type.

 This could bring some mistakes and undesired behaviors, like this one. Because result could be undefined, it mark as an error using a method that belongs to the number type.

## What is a valid return type -  function errors during implementation vs when using the function
If the implementation leads TS to infer several return types, and I don't type all of those, an error could appear. Additionally, is better to detect errors when implementing the function rather than when using it like in the above image (this is a 'late error' when I already implement the function, it could be in other module, and I force the developer to go back to the implementation to understand why is this error happening).

A valid return type should enclose all paths the function is intended to work, in this case, I want the function return a number, but it could return undefined as well. So I could fix this earlier.
