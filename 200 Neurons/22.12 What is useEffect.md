[[12.12 React|React]]

A component may mount, update or unmount; an effect can: start synchronizing something, and later stop synchronizing it; do something after the component renders, do something when a state or props change, or set up or clean u things (like event listeners, timers, etc.). This can happen several times if the effect depends on props and state that change over time. As your code changes, synchronization will need to happen more or less often.

Effects are reactive blocks of code. They re-synchronize when the values you read inside of them change. Unlike event handlers, which only run once per interaction, Effects run whenever synchronization is necessary.

Interaction of a component with its exterior world, like a server making a fetch request. Effects lets synchronize the component on rendering or a reactive/state value. The `useEffect()` hook tells React to run some code when something else is happening. This is the basic syntax:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // 1. Effect code (runs after render)
  
  return () => {
    // 2. Cleanup code (optional)
  }
}, [/* 3. dependency array */])
```

Common use cases: fetching data, subscriptions, manual DOM manipulations, setting up event listeners, timers and intervals, browser API interactions.

```jsx
// Run once when component mounts
useEffect(() => {
    // Do something
}, []);

// Run whenever 'someValue' changes
useEffect(() => {
    // Do something
}, [someValue]);

// Run on every render
useEffect(() => {
    // Do something
});

// Cleanup when component unmounts
useEffect(() => {
    // Do something
    return () => {
        // Cleanup code
    };
}, []);
```

## The useEffect hook
In this example, the `setInterval()` function is being called **in each** render, causing the count variable increase uncontrollably, because each render calls again the set interval. 

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Clock() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  setInterval(() => {
    setCounter(count => count + 1)
  }, 1000);

  return (
    <p>{counter} seconds have passed.</p>
  );
}
```

Wrapping a behavior like this within the `useEffect()` hook will move it outside the rendering calculation, it expects a callback function.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function Clock() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setInterval(() => {
      setCounter(count => count + 1)
    }, 1000);
  })

  return (
    <p>{counter} seconds have passed.</p>
  );
}
```

 But this is not enough as another argument, the dependency array, is required. 
### The dependency array
By default, `useEffect` hook runs on every render. However, the array of dependencies allow the hook to re-sync only when those dependencies are changed. Usually the linter will shows which dependencies to expect. Also check [[22.12 Reactive values|this note]]. 

When passing an empty array, the `useEffect` hook won't run anytime other than the initial component render. If the effect's logic depends directly on a prop, usually, that props should be in the dependency array; in this example the effect implementation is self-dependent. In [[22.12 useEffect lifecycle#How react verifies if an effect can re-sync|this example]] every time the `roomId` prop change, react will re-sync the effect. 

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function Clock() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setInterval(() => {
      setCounter(count => count + 1)
    }, 1000);
  }, [])

  return (
    <p>{counter} seconds have passed.</p>
  );
}
```

The key answer is, does this effect depend on something to either sync **or** unsync?

### The clean up function
In most cases, when react start synchronizing it won't to doing so when the component unmounts; this is why a clean up function is required.

>The clean up function is called every time the component is unmounted from the virtual DOM due to a change in its state/props or parent re-render. 

There's not a clear rule to determine when a clean up function is required, but as a general rule, is required when the code does something 'continuous' or 'persistent' like using `setInterval`, `setTimeout`, adding event listeners, API connections, and third-party library connections. 

```jsx
// âœ… NEEDS cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  // 1. Intervals
  const timer = setInterval(() => {}, 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(timer);

  // 2. Event Listeners
  window.addEventListener('resize', handler);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handler);

  // 3. Subscriptions
  const subscription = stream.subscribe();
  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, []);
```

Think of: If you "turn something on" -> you need to "turn it off". "Did my effect CREATE or CONNECT to something that keeps running?"  If yes -> need cleanup, If no -> probably don't need cleanup. 

Following the above example:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function Clock() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const key = setInterval(() => {
      setCounter(count => count + 1)
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(key);
    };
  }, [])

  return (
    <p>{counter} seconds have passed.</p>
  );
}
```

## Don't use objects and functions as dependencies
If you create objects and functions during rendering and then read them from an Effect, they will be different on every render. This will cause your Effect to re-synchronize every time.
