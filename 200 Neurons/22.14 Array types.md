[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

In React, don't type arrays with `Array<string>`, as the `<>` may cause a problem. To type arrays in TS use `string[]`, or `string[][]`.  

For type-ing array of objects, use the same syntax as above.

Array's length is arbitrary, I cam pop and push elements. Arrays of fixed length are tuples. 

Remember, declaring a variable with const means the variable that hold a reference to the array can't be reassigned, but its content can be modify.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // Allowed: Modifying the contents of the array
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

arr = [5, 6, 7]; // Error: Cannot reassign a `const` variable
```

With let, both this can be modified, the reference and the content.

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // Allowed: Modifying the contents of the array
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

arr = [5, 6, 7]; // Allowed: Reassigning the variable to a new array
console.log(arr); // [5, 6, 7]
```
