[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

In React, don't type arrays with `Array<string>`, as the `<>` may cause a problem. To type arrays in TS use `string[]`, or `string[][]`.  

For type-ing array of objects, use the same syntax as above.

Array's length is arbitrary, I cam pop and push elements. Arrays of fixed length are tuples.
