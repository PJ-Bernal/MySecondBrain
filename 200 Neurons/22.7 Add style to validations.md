[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

I can target form controls that passed or failed validations using the `:valid` or `:invalid` pseudo-classes. Check [this pen](https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/dyVRMwx). But there are more pseudo-classes to style validations.

For example I can style a placeholder attribute with the `::placeholder` pseudo-element.

```css
input[type="email"]::placeholder {
  color: blue;
}
```
