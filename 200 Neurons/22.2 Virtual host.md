## httpd vhost conf or the virtual host
![[Pasted image 20240310144219.png|center|200]]


The file is located under `apache/conf/extra` under the file name of `httpd-vhosts.conf`. To create a virtual host the directive must be included as shown above.
### What is a virtual host
Virtual host is the capability to run multiple websites under a single machine. I can have IP or name based websites, meaning I can have different IPs for each website, or different name for each website for the same IP.  

I can apply directives to specific hosts or websites by using the virtual host scop directive.

By default, to access a website using the virtual host, this kind of 'file path' URL is required. But I can change this URL.

### Changing the virtual host 
The DocumentRoot is the path to the directory that contain the projects. The localhost will then be routed to the specified `DocumentRoot`. 

What is happening in reality is that the "real" URL is `locahost/wd2_cms`

In this case, the DocumentRoot contains only one file so it works fine, but with multiple won't. 
### For multiple applications
The above method works if within the Document root I have one project or application. With several projects is required to point that domain to a localhost IP address in the host file. This allows target specific applications when visiting localhost. 

The `ServerName` is the address I'll access through the browser. 

>[!warning]
>If any `ServerName` ends in `.localhost` the IP configuration is not required, because the browser will know the address is on my local webserver automatically.

If the address is not ending in `.localhost` I have to modify the host file(`windows/system 32/drivers/etc/host`). Here I modified the last line to modify out localhost ip address to `127.0.0.1 ServerName`, where the string following the ip is the domain I want to type in the search bar. Because I'm using a local host, all the IP's are the same.

Finally, both project are working.

#### Additional configuration 
Depending on the `httpd.conf` file, I probably have to include this additional configuration with the directory directive.

- Require all granted: allow the content of the content to be access on the browser.
- Allowoverride all: allows ht access files in the folder.
