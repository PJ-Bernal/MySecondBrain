[[12.6 Git and Github|Git and Github]]

## Change the commit message
`git commit --amend -m "new message"`This command changes the commit message of the _last_ commit. 

>[!example]-
>![[Pasted image 20240102114944 1.png|center|300]]

If the command is `git commit --amend` the command will open the last commit into the editor to edit the commit message. 

[question:: Look for another uses for the amend command]

## Commit messages
>[!quote]
>A project’s long-term success rests (among other things) on its maintainability, and a maintainer has few tools more powerful than his project’s log.

A good commit message must explain what problem my changes solve and how it solves them (remember GitHub has a 72-character limit). Commit message contains:

- Subject: summary of changes I made to the project. Git assumed as the first line of the commit. 
- Body: a description of what I did. The lines after the break line from the subject.

>`Add missin link and alt text to the company's logo` (subject)
>%% %%
>`Screen readers won't read the images to users with disabilities without this information` (body)

>[!info]
>To create a useful revision history, teams should first agree on a commit message convention that define at least:
>- Style: markup syntax, wrap margins, grammar, capitalization, punctuation; to create commit history that actually does get read on a regular basis.
>- Content: what information should and should not contain.
>- Metadata: how the commits should be tracked, id, pull request number, hash, etc.

The above process is idealistic and there are already seven rules to achieve neat commit messages.
## Rules for a commit message
>[!summary]- 
In summary, try not to use the 72 available characters. The first line is treated as the subject of the commit, and the rest the body. The blank line separating the body is critical, some commands like log, shortlog or rebase can get confused if I write the two together. Bullet points with `- ` and a space are ok. 

If an issue tracker is being used, put references at the bottom line `resolves: #123`

[question:: how does the blank line separating the body and the subject affect commands like log, shortlog and rebase]
[question:: what is an issue tracker in git commit messages]

Here are the seven rules for a good commit message:
### Separate subject from body with a blank line
>[!quote]- From the `git commit` manpage
>Though not required, it’s a good idea to begin the commit message with a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. The text up to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used throughout Git. For example, Git-format-patch(1) turns a commit into email, and it uses the title on the Subject line and the rest of the commit in the body.

Not all commits requires both a subject and a body, for example, when the change made is simple. With the `lg` alias as it is [[22.6 Basic Git workflow#Creating alias|here]], the subject is enclosed between `> <` and the rest is the body.

>[!multi-column]
>
>`git log --online` prints just the subject. 
>%% %%
>![[Pasted image 20240130145022.png]]

>`git shortlog` groups commits by user showing the subject line only.
>%% %%

>[!warning]
>The break line is important as some Git commands recognize a distinction between the subject line, the break line and the body 'paragraph'. Therefore, the break line is required. 

[question:: difference between git show, git diff or git log -p]
### Limit the subject line to 50 characters
With a maximum of 72 in extreme scenarios.
### Capitalize the subject line
Just begin all subject lines with a capital letter `Fixed bug in line 100`, instead of `fix...`
### Don't end the subject line with a period
`Fixed bug in line 100` instead of `Fixed bug in line 100.`
### Use the imperative mood in the subject line
Write as if giving a command or instruction, this means imperative, `Clear the room`, `Close the door`. A little bit rude, but necessary for subject lines. Use infinitive verbs. 

A proper subject line will complete the following sentence: if applied, this commit will...
- If applied, this commit will `refactor subsystem X for readability`.
- If applied, this commit will `release version 1.0.0`
### Wrap the body at 72 characters
Don't use more than 72 characters within the body. 
### Use the body to explain what and why vs how
Code should be self-explanatory, so explaining how is irrelevant. Focus on the clear reasons why the change was made.
