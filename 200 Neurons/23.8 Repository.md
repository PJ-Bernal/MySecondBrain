# About repository classes
The repository class is in charge of data persistence allowing the code to use objects without knowing how they are persisted. This class is in charge of abstract away the details of how the persistence is happening from the service. 
# Using mock data
Create a repository, in this case, mock pie repository, which implements the interface of pie repository.

This mock repository will be consumed by another class, therefore, I must register the repository in the DI container.

# Register the repository
In `program.cs`. For repositories usually use add scope since that will create a singleton while the request is being handled.
