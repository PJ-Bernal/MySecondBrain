>Break and next are important loop control concepts that can be used with `loop` or **any other loop** construct in Ruby.

>[!important]
The return value of any loop can be anything I send to either `break` or `next` as a parameter. Otherwise, it will return nil except for `for`.

## `break`
`break` allows to stop and exit the loop at an point, so the code after `break` won't be executed.

>i = 0
loop do
  i = i + 1
  puts i
  break         # exit the loop
end
># 1
>```

>[!multi-column]
>
>In this example, detail I'm coding the condition and within, put the break, quite different from the first example. 
>
>```ruby
>i = 0
>loop do
>  i = i + 2
>  puts i
>  if i == 10
>    break       # exit the loop
>  end
>end
>```

## `next`
Skip the current iteration and start the next one, so the code above next is not going to be executed.

```ruby
i = 0
loop do
  i = i + 2
  if i == 4
    next        # skip rest of the code in this iteration
  end
  puts i
  if i == 10
    break
  end
end
# 2
# 6
# 8
# 10
```

## How to return something with break and next
As always, in Ruby, everything has a return type. In this example, using `break` the return value is `nil`. 

```ruby
# Example of `break`
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.each do |num|
  break if num < 2
  puts num
end
# console output
=> nil
```

However, I can pass it an argument so it can returns the argument when break or next.

```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.each do |num|
  break num if num < 2
  puts num
end
# console output
=> 1
```

```ruby 
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.map do |num|
  next 'even' if num.even?
  num
end
# console output
=> [1, "even", 3]
```


## redo
Repeat the current iteration or step, without evaluating the terminating condition. 

```ruby
10.times do |i|
  puts "Iteration #{i}"
  redo if i > 2
end

# Iteration 0
# Iteration 1
# Iteration 2
# Iteration 3
# Iteration 3
...
```

```ruby
restart = false
  
# Using for loop 
for x in 2..20
    if x == 15
        if restart == false
  
            # Printing values 
            puts "Re-doing when x = " + x.to_s 
            restart = true
  
            # Using Redo Statement 
            redo
        end
    end
    puts x 
end
```

```

6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
Re-doing when x = 15
15
16
```

This is a clear example the loop repeats in the same iteration and the terminating condition is not evaluated. 

```ruby
i = 1 
until i > 10 
  print "#{i} " 
  i += 1 
  redo if i > 10 
end
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13...
```
## return
Do NOT use return to exit a loop, since that will exit the whole method that contains it as well!
