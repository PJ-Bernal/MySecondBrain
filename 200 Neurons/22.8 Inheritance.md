## What is inheritance

## A basic example
This is the code for this note. In this main class, the toaster can toast only two slices at a time. Detail I can only toast two slices, because the maximum number is 2.

But I want to create a pro version of the toaster class that can toast four slices. Now comparting the toaster pro class (right) with the toaster, the addSlice and toast methods are the same. This means the toaster pro `is a` toaster, with an adding feature to toast bagel and 4 slices.

## How to implement inheritance
I can use the `extends` keyword, that will make the class to inherits all the private and protective methods, attributes and constants. So the toaster pro class can look like that now. 

>Inheritance allows overwriting and that's what's happening with the size attribute.

>Detail here the toaster is toasting 4 slices using the toaster pro class.

## This variable in child classes
In child classes, `$this` refers to the current class object, this means it doesn't necessarily is referring to the parent class.  Detail the `var_dump` is referring to the toaster pro class because that's the object is being invoked and used in the above image, even though the method called is from the toaster class. 

![[Pasted image 20240617120310.png]]

## What can be overwritten
Only public and protective attributes, methods and constants can be accessed and overwritten. When an attribute is private in the parent class, I can't overwrite it in the child class.  Detail I the toaster pro is toasting 2 slices instead of 4. 

![[Pasted image 20240617120505.png]]

## Child classes can't changes access modifiers of parent classes
Detail size is public but then is private, this won't work. 

![[Pasted image 20240617120753.png]]

But I can protected on the parent class, and on the child class keep the protected or change to public in the child class.

![[Pasted image 20240617120855.png]]

## The protected access modifier
This modifier is essentially the same as private but but it extends to the child classes. 

## Overwriting constructors
(The following applies to other methods than the constructor). 

When I overwrite (by changing something) a constructor (like in this case I only add the slices) in the child class, by default, the class is not going to call the parent's constructor. This is what this error is about. 

![[Pasted image 20240617121854.png]]

To prof this, if the constructor in the child is commented, now, everything works.

![[Pasted image 20240617121936.png]]

### How to overwrite parent methods
Because of the above, I need to use the `parent` keyword, followed by the scope resolution operator, then the method name to overwrite the method and the corresponding arguments for the method to work. Now everything works and I overwrite the constructor method with a size of 4. 

![[Pasted image 20240617122116.png]]

The order matter when calling a parent method, in this example, the size is overwritten but then I call the parent constructor, so the size is 2 again. Thus, try to always put it at the top, after some special logic (like prepare arguments or validation). 

![[Pasted image 20240617122231.png]]
### If the parent class doesn't have a constructor I can' overwrite it
Detail I get an error. 

![[Pasted image 20240617122411.png]]

### Parent class with no constructor but child with a constructor
This is valid, detail in this example I don't have a constructor in the parent class, but I have one in the child. As a detail, I have to initialize in the parent class the attribute that is going to be overwritten in the child class.

![[Pasted image 20240617122602.png]]

### Overwriting other methods than the constructor
Detail nothing happens because the child class is not calling the add slice method explicitly, I need to use the parent keyword. 

![[Pasted image 20240617132615.png]]

This image profs that I need to call the parent method if I wanted to overwrite something (in this case nothing is being overwrite). But if I don't want to overwrite the method, I don't need to call the parent method. 

![[Pasted image 20240617133006.png]]

### Method signature compatibilty
The method signature of the parent class must match the signature of the child method. Detail the signature of the child uses int instead of string.

![[Pasted image 20240617133202.png]]

 This also applies also to return types. 
![[Pasted image 20240617133243.png]]

>[!important]
>These compatibility rules don't apply to constructors, but attributes.
>
>Detail the constructor signature of the child class is different from the parent, but that's fine. Remember if  I called a parent method that requires a parameter, I need to write that parameter when I call the parent method in the child class. I can do this by creating a variable with the same name, or hard coding a value, without listing that parameter in the child class constructor.

### Name arguments can cause troubles
Detail in the method the parameter is called `$sliceX`, but I name the argument in the method invocation as `slice` so this can cause a problem.

![[Pasted image 20240617133929.png]]

I need to use the same name to make it work.

![[Pasted image 20240617134217.png]]
## How to decide which class or methods can be extended or overwritten 
I can use the `final` keyword. If I define a class with final, means I can't extend from that class (`final class toaster`). This apply to methods and classes. Thus, final can be use to prevent class inheritance and method overwriting. 

## Multiple inheritance is not supported in PHP
This means I can not have a class that extends from two classes. But it does support hierarchical  extends, so I can have a toaster pro pro class that extends from toaster pro. 

![[Pasted image 20240617134807.png]]

For example here, the dollar class inherit from multiple classes through a hierarchy, which is not multiple inheritance, because in reality its only inherit from the number class. 

## Inheritance flaws
- Inheritance could break encapsulation because it has access to all public and protected attributes, methods and constants from the parent. For example here I'm changing directly the attribute size from 2 to 4, and in this case is ok, but is not always a good thing. 

![[Pasted image 20240617135141.png]]

- When inheriting from a parent class, the child class inherit things that might not be required, because the child inherits all the public and protective attributes, methods and constants. For example, the toaster could have a method that the toaster pro implementation doesn't require because is deprecated now, well the toaster pro class now has that deprecated method. This creates coupling between parent and child classes. 

	A possible solution to this, is overwrite that method I don't need by throwing an exception, but for Gio that's not a god design. If I find myself doing this, I need to reconsider using inheritance. It may want to use composition instead. 

![[Pasted image 20240617135632.png]]

## Type hint an object used as a parameter
Detail this works as expected.
![[Pasted image 20240617140818.png|center|350]]

But what happen if I use an object's parent class in a function that requires a child object? This results in an error because the `$toaster` object of the `Toaster` class is not a Toaster pro, instead, toaster pro **is a** toaster.  

![[Pasted image 20240617141001.png|center|350]]

To fix that I can type hint the parameter in the function or method declaration, writing the data type of the variable as the parent class, `Toaster` in this example, and now use both toaster or toaster pro objects as arguments of the method/function.

>[!important] Bad design
>
>This only works because the toast method is in both a classes. But when using a method that is not in both the parent and child class, some code bases to solve this check if the method toastBagel exists or if the object `$toaster` is instance of toaster pro, then call toastBagel, if not, then call toast. But doing this check is bad design, better to use composition.

## How to determine when to use inheritance
When something has a **is a** relationship I can use inheritance, in this case, the toaster pro is a toaster so I can perfectly use inheritance. If that **is a** doesn't make sense, I might want to use [[22.8 Composition|composition]].
