[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

FF are functions that use closures to return an object that can contain any type of value (primitive, object, function, etc.). This object is bind to a variable or return as a function, thus, I can use what ever the FF return with dot notation.

FF don't use the `new` keyword, but set up and return a [[22.5 What are closures - same name variables and different lexical scopes - functions as return value|closure]] (either an object or a function). 

>In JavaScript, any function can create new objects. When it’s not a constructor function, it’s called a factory function

>[!warning]
>- Factory functions don't use any type of prototype chain, which can cause a performance penalty only when I create thousands of objects. But they use another [[22.5 Inheritance with FF|type of inheritance]]. 
>- Don't forget to use the [[22.5 Unpack values from an object or array -  the destructing assignment syntax|destructing syntax]] with factory functions, and the [[22.5 Property values shorthand for factory functions and object literals - shorthand for methods|property value shorthand]].
>- The idea of FF is that they can produce several objects. Different to modules in which I encapsule a behaviors. 

One of the main advantages of using closures is to add private properties. The return statement when using FF and [[22.5 FF additional uses - grouping or encapsulate code - the module pattern -  IIFE|modules]] must always have `{ }`, because a FF returns an [[22.5 What is an object - object creation - object constructors and object literals - user defined functions - add properties to object literals#What is an object?|object]] (because is returning something between `{}`). 

```js
function createUser (name) {
  const discordName = "@" + name;

  let reputation = 0;
  const getReputation = () => reputation;
  const giveReputation = () => reputation++;

  return { name, discordName, getReputation, giveReputation };
}

const josh = createUser("josh"); //Here the closure is created and get and give reputation have access to reputation

// Detail I have access to what the FF return using dot notai
josh.giveReputation(); // *
josh.giveReputation(); // *

console.log({
  discordName: josh.discordName,
  reputation: josh.getReputation()
});
// logs { discordName: "@josh", reputation: 2 }
```

The return statement is using the [[22.5 Property values shorthand for factory functions and object literals - shorthand for methods|property value shorthand]], thus, an object is being return. Detail the reputation variable is not being returned, therefore, is a private property, but it makes part of the closure.

Because `reputation` is part of the closure (created wen the `createUser` function was called), the "closure functions" `getReputation()` and `giveReputation()` can access this variable when their are invoked in *. 

## Why use FF over functions
### Object de-clutering
One of the main advantages of using FF beside private variables is that I can decide what to return, so I don't need to pollute the returned object with unnecessary variables or functions, I can have private properties and values that operate inside the object, and then return only what I need.

>The return statement includes the public interface. 
### Encapsulation
The internal state of the private variables or functions are protected from external manipulation.
### Interface simplification
Only the necessary methods are exposed, making the object easier to use and understand.
### Flexibility
You can change the internal implementation without affecting the public interface.
## The return statement
The return statement should have the things I want the object to do, without the thing it need to work. If I expose a variable in the return, this means it can be accessible outside of the FF and maybe manipulated. So, for example in the above example I should have not return name, because the object doesn't really need that in order to work.

Also, returning a variable is not that common as I'm exposing it, and it can be manipulated. 

I can return bindings, meaning, I can return any type of value (properties/values, functions or even  hard-coded functions, like in [[22.5 FF additional uses - grouping or encapsulate code - the module pattern -  IIFE#The module pattern|this example]]). 
## Example 
In this example, books is a private variable and is valid and find book are private methods that are not return as an object. The other four methods are return, so they can be used by the user 

This example use FF to return an object using a function. 
```js
function createBookManager(initialBooks = []) {
  // Private variable
  let books = [...initialBooks];

  // Private function
  function isValidBook(book) {
    return book && typeof book.title === 'string' && typeof book.author === 'string';
  }

  // Private function
  function findBookIndex(title) {
    return books.findIndex(book => book.title.toLowerCase() === title.toLowerCase());
  }

  // Public methods
  function addBook(book) {
    if (isValidBook(book)) {
      books.push(book);
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }

  function removeBook(title) {
    const index = findBookIndex(title);
    if (index !== -1) {
      books.splice(index, 1);
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }

  function getBooks() {
    return [...books];
  }

  function getBookCount() {
    return books.length;
  }

  // Return only the public interface
  return {
    addBook,
    removeBook,
    getBooks,
    getBookCount
  };
}

// Usage
const libraryManager = createBookManager([
  { title: "1984", author: "George Orwell" },
  { title: "To Kill a Mockingbird", author: "Harper Lee" }
]);

console.log(libraryManager.getBookCount()); // 2
libraryManager.addBook({ title: "The Great Gatsby", author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald" });
console.log(libraryManager.getBookCount()); // 3
libraryManager.removeBook("1984");
console.log(libraryManager.getBooks());
// [
//   { title: "To Kill a Mockingbird", author: "Harper Lee" },
//   { title: "The Great Gatsby", author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald" }
// ]
```

Here the FF is bind to a variable called `Player`. Detail both approaches are like the same, because once the FF is created, I bind it to another variable, and the use dot notation. 

>[!important]
>The difference relies the first method define a function like it was a regular function, but the second uses an arrow function. 

```js
const Player = (name, level) => {
    let health = level * 2;
    const getLevel = () => level;
    const getName  = () => name;
    const die = () => {
      // uh oh
    };
    const damage = x => {
      health -= x;
      if (health <= 0) {
        die();
      }
    };
    const attack = enemy => {
      if (level < enemy.getLevel()) {
        damage(1);
        console.log(`${enemy.getName()} has damaged ${name}`);
      }
      if (level >= enemy.getLevel()) {
        enemy.damage(1);
        console.log(`${name} has damaged ${enemy.getName()}`);
      }
    };
    return {attack, damage, getLevel, getName};
  };
  
  const jimmie = Player('jim', 10);
  const badGuy = Player('jeff', 5);
  jimmie.attack(badGuy);
```
