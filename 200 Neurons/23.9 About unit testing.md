# About unit test
Unit test should be simple to write, and have low complexity, fast to execute and encapsulated (meaning they are not affected by the rest of the system, the db, the network, etc.), this means, if the unit test fails, the tested code fails and not something the code is dependent on like the db or the network.

# Unit, vs integration vs functional testing
Integration test evaluate whether or not two or more components work together correctly. They test the app infrastructure, for example, a call into a repo into an actual db, or a network call. This test could test the full request/response cycle. They are less isolated and more complex than unit test. 

Functional or end-to-end test, test the full request/response cycle as I were a user. This could use postman. But generally are more complex.
