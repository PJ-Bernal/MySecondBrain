## Avoid callback hell
When dealing with multiple async operations the code may be clutter with a lot of callbacks that depend on each other. With promises is more clear.

```js
// Using callbacks
getData(function(a) {
  getMoreData(a, function(b) {
    getMoreData(b, function(c) {
      getMoreData(c, function(d) {
        // And so on...
      });
    });
  });
});

// Using promises
getData()
  .then(a => getMoreData(a))
  .then(b => getMoreData(b))
  .then(c => getMoreData(c))
  .then(d => {
    // Much more readable
  });
```

## Error handling
With callbacks, I need to handle errors within every callback. Promises centralize error handling with catch.

```js
getData(function(err, result) {
  if (err) {
    handleError(err);
  } else {
    // Process result
  }
});

// Promises
getData()
  .then(result => {
    // Process result
  })
  .catch(err => handleError(err));
```

## Composition
Promises ease compose and chain operations, specially when callbacks depend on each other.

## Parallel operations
Methods like Promise.all() make it easy to handle multiple asynchronous operations concurrently.

```js
Promise.all([fetchData1(), fetchData2(), fetchData3()])
  .then(([result1, result2, result3]) => {
    // Use results
  });
```

## Better flow control
The code can rely on finally to execute code regardless of success of failure of the promise. 

## Only-once resolution
A Promise is guaranteed to be called only once: either resolved or rejected. This can prevent certain types of bugs that can occur with callbacks.

## When to stick with callbacks
- When working with older APIs that don't support Promises.
- For very simple, one-off asynchronous operations where the benefits of Promises might be overkill.
- In environments where you need to support older browsers that don't have Promise support
