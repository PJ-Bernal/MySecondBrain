# About OPTIONS method
This method represents a request for information about the communication option available at a certain URI. Allow the consumer to determine the options or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of an API. 
# Adding support for options
Add  new action method in the authors controller.

The methods that use the route attribute: `[Route(api/authors)]`,  are GET, HEAD, POST. So options is at the same route level, so options can work with those three methods. 

The options are return in the allow response header as a comma separated list of method names.

## Adding a new header
Use `Response.Headers.Add`, passing the header name which is Allow and the pass the allowed methods at that route level.

A successful options request should return a 200 even when empty, in which case the content length field is 0 (ASP take care of that for me).

>I could include a response body to describe the options, but the format is not covered by the HTTP standard.
