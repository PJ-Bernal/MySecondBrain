[[12.12 React|React]]


- Re-render: when React updates the DOM to reflect new state or props. The component function is called again, but the component instance isn't destroyed and recreated.
- Re-mounting: when a component is completely unmounted (removed from the DOM) and then mounted again (added back to the DOM). This creates a new instance of the component.
