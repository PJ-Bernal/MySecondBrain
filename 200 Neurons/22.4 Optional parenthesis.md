[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Many Rubyists will leave off parentheses when calling methods as a style choice. For example, say() could be rewritten as just say. With arguments, instead of say("hi"), it could just be say "hi". This leads to more fluid reading of code, but sometimes it can be confusing. Keep that in mind when you're reading Ruby; it can get tricky deciphering between local variables and method names!
