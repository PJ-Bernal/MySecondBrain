## The `document` node?
>[!multi-column]
>
>`document` is an interface that represents any web page loaded (it represents the entire HTML document) in the browser and serves as an entry point into the DOM tree. It's a built-in object node, meaning when an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object.

The `document` object is the root of every node in the DOM,  meaning it includes elements like `<body>`, `<p>`, `<table>`, etc. Because of its higher hierarchy, almost all of the node selector or method, starts with the `document.` syntax.

Below is a chart consisting of the root elements that every document will contain. Even if a blank HTML file is loaded into a browser, these three nodes will be added and parsed into the DOM. Remember the `document` node is always there as it's an object of the `window` property. Since the html, head, and body elements are so common, they have their own properties on the document.

This is why here the live viewer shows three nodes, even though the document is empty.
