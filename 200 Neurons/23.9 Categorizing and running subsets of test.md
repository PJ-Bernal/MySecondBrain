By default, test are grouped by class.

However I may want to categorize test from different classes with the same category. To categorize use the `[Trait]` attribute on the test methods, with a key value pair. It can be used as class level. 

For example, in this class one test has to deal with creating an employee, and the other with salary.

Then right click on the project directory -> build. And the test explorer shows the traits. To group use that button, the select traits grouping.

Then the test are grouped by traits.
