The state to handle every request is contained within the request itself, meaning, the state is not kept on the server but on the client. A response must contain all necessary information to serve the request.

The combination of URI, headers and body should be sufficient when making a request or getting a response. 

This improves scalability because the state to handle the request is contain in the request itself, there's no server-level session state.
