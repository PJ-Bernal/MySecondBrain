[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

## What are symbols
Strings can be changed, so every time a string is used, Ruby has to store it in memory even if an existing string with the same value already exists. Symbols, on the other hand, are stored in memory only once, making them faster in certain situations, they are like "unique" identifiers. 

>[!example]
> E.g. if you do puts "Hello!" 10 times then 10 actual string objects will be created (and then discarded, because theyâ€™re not being used any longer). On the other hand, if youâ€™d use a symbol for this and do puts :hello 10 times, then only one single object will be created, and re-used.

One common application where symbols are preferred over strings are the keys in hashes, I don't want to print or change its value.

## Create a symbol
Put a colon at the beginning of some text `:my_symbol`, `:"surprisingly, this is also a symbol"` However, is a good practice to use snake_case with no spaces or other kind of strings. 

## Symbols vs strings
The `.object_id` method returns an integer identifier for an object. 

```ruby
"string" == "string"  #=> true

"string".object_id == "string".object_id  #=> false

:symbol.object_id == :symbol.object_id    #=> true
```
