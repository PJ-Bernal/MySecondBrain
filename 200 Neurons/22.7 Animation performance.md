[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

When animating, remember:
1. Changing the height affects the layout, if an elements shrinks all of it siblings will need to move up to fill the space.
2. `background-color` is somewhat expensive to animate.
3. `transform` and `opacity` are cheap. If an animation requires to change the `width` or `left` rules, use `transform`.
4. Test the animations on the site/app/platform is going to be deploy.
