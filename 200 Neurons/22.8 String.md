[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

A string literal can be specified in four different ways: 
- [[22.8 Single and double quotes|single and double quotes]].
- Heredoc.
- Nowdoc
## How to access a specific character?
As in arrays, the first letter has index 0, then 1, and so on. For that utilize the "array notation". With a negative index number, the index starts at the end of the variable but **the index starts at 1**.

>[!example]
>```PHP
>$firstName = 'Pablo';
>$lastName = 'Bernal';
>$name = $firstName . ' ' . $lastName;
>echo $name[1]; // a
>echo $name[0]; // P
>echo $name[-3]; // n // index -1 is l
## How to change a letter?
Once again using the "array notation". Same situation with negative index numbers. 

>[!example]
>```PHP
>$firstName = 'Pablo';
>$lastName = 'Bernal';
>$name = $firstName . ' ' . $lastName;
>echo $name; // Pablo Bernal
>$name[1] = 'A';
>echo $name; // PAblo Bernal
>$name[-3] = 'N';// PAblo BerNal
>```
>%% %%
>
>>[!important]
>>Detail (in the last echo) how the name variable keeps the changes, so the change values overwrite previous values. 

>[!warning]
>Letter can be added even outside of the boundaries of the string. For example, if the last index of the string is 10, I can add a letter at the index 20, and PHP will add only **one** space and the index will be 21.
>%% %%
>```PHP
>var_dump($name); // string(12) "PAblo BerAal" 
>$name[20] = 'O';
>var_dump($name); // string(21) "PAblo BerAal O"

The following two ways are used to handle multi line and long strings that could contain complex expressions and both single and double quotes. 

The main difference is that heredoc treats the string as it is enclosed in double quotes, where nowdocs in single quotes.

## Heredoc
[question:: What is a real use case for heredoc and nowdoc]
In Heredocs I can create variables using `<<<` followed by an identifier. Behind scenes "everything is render" as it is enclosed in double quotes, therefore, there is no need (and also won't work) the concatenation; everything is a string or gets interpreted as a variable. 

>[!example]
>Detail each line is printed in the same line. To have break lines the `nl2br($variable)` function must be used. In this case `TEXT` is the identifier of the variable. 
>```PHP
>$x = 1;
`$text = <<<WHATEVER
>Line 1 of content
>Line 2 of content
>Line 3 of content        $x
>WHATEVER;
>echo $text; // Line 1 of content Line 2 of content Line 3 of content 1
>echo nl2br($text);
>// Line 1 of content
>// Line 2 of content
>// Line 3 of content 1
>```

## Nowdoc
The syntax to create a nowdoc is similar but the identifier needds to be enclosed in single quotes. 

>[!example]
>With nowdoc, the variables won't be interpreted. 
>```PHP
>$x = 1;
`$text = <<<'WHATEVER'
>Line 1 of content
>Line 2 of content
>Line 3 of content        $x
>'WHATEVER';
>echo $text; // Line 1 of content Line 2 of content Line 3 of content $x
>echo nl2br($text);
>// Line 1 of content
>// Line 2 of content
>// Line 3 of content $x
>```

## Use cases for heredoc and nowdoc
### Whitespace
Where using heredoc or nowdoc, any space will render in the as one whitespace in the browser, but the space is on the string.


```PHP
$x = 1;
$text = <<<WHATEVER
Hi       $x
WHATEVER;
var_dump($text);// string(7) "Hi 1" 
```
### No more escaping sequences
When having multiple line strings or complex expressions, both improves readability avoiding a bunch of concatenation quotes, etc. Also there is no need to [[22.8 Escape sequences|escape sequences]]; single or double quotes can be used freely. 

```PHP
    $text = <<<PERRO
    Line 1 of content .        $firstName
    There is no need to escape this " '
    I just write and that's it
    PERRO;
    echo nl2br($text);
// Line 1 of content . Pablo
//There is no need to escape this " '
// I just write and that's it 
```

### Generate HTML dynamically
```PHP
$x = 1;
$text = <<<WHATEVER
<div>
    <p>Hello</p>
    <p>World</p>
</div>
WHATEVER;
echo $text;
```

Gets printed as two p tags.
