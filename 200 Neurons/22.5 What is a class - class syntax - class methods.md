## What is a class
Template built on prototypes with special syntax and some little additional features to the classic prototype inheritance. 

## Class syntax
>[!blank-container|float-left] 
>```js
>class MyClass {
  // class methods
  constructor() { ... }
  method1() { ... } 
  ...
}
>```

>[!blank-container|float-right]
>```js
>class User {
>
>  constructor(name) {
>    this.name = name;
>  }
>
>  sayHi() {
>    alert(this.name);
>  }
>
>}
>
>// Usage:
>let user = new User("John");
>user.sayHi();
>```

This is the general syntax of a class. Object creation with `new` will call the `constructor()` automatically. 

Detail there is no comma between the class methods. 

The body of a class is executed in strict mode even without the "use strict" directive.

Like functions, classes can be define as [[22.5 Class expressions - class declarations|expressions or declarations]].


## What does the class keyword do
The `class` keyword creates a new construct that is a **function** with the name of the class, whose methods and the constructor itself are store inside of its `prototype`.  ^78695f


```js
class User {
  constructor(name) { this.name = name; }
  sayHi() { alert(this.name); }
}

// proof: User is a function
alert(typeof User); // function
// ...or, more precisely, the constructor method
alert(User === User.prototype.constructor); // true

// The methods are in User.prototype, e.g:
alert(User.prototype.sayHi); // the code of the sayHi method

// there are exactly two methods in the prototype
alert(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(User.prototype)); // constructor, sayHi
```

## About the constructor
Special method for create and instantiated an object. The parameters inside of the constructor are initialized based on input parameters or a fix value.

>class User {
>  constructor() { this.name = 'Ana'; }
>  sayHi() { alert(this.name); }
>}
>
>const test = new User();
>```

This example shows a fix value. Detail I can't instantiate the object like `const test = new User('Pablo');`

This doesn't allow to provide a default value and at the same time let the object definition to use an input to define the property value. Using a constructor by itself is either provide a default value or expect an input. 

The following code provide a solution using [[22.8 Class properties, methods and constructor|class properties]] and constructors to use a default value or let the user define one. 

![[22.5 Class properties -  class properties and constructor explanation#^4c1dd0]]

## Class methods
All class methods are added automatically to the class `prototype`, thus, all class object instances have a pointer to this methods. This is a huge difference from object literals and CF where each method have a copy to the properties and methods.

>   alert(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);

> - Static methods are used as utility functions.
