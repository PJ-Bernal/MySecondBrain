[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]


This is another example of how to implement specific media types.

First, create the classes for this types.

![[Pasted image 20250227102628.png]]

Add the respective controller.

![[Pasted image 20250227102642.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250227102659.png]]

The api of this example have to action methods that map to the same resource URI `/api/bookId`. GetBook and GetBookWithConcatenatedAuthorName.

![[Pasted image 20250227102815.png|center|450]]

This causes an error, because the request matches multiple endpoints and .net doesn't know which one to select. 

![[Pasted image 20250227102846.png|center|450]]

So, use an action constraint to match or not match a specific request to a route. See, [[23.9 Using vendor specific media type on input#In the controller|this note]] to remember how to use this constraint. The add the requestheader action matches media type.

![[Pasted image 20250227103759.png|center|450]]

So, this get method will aceept two media types, the json and the book+json. 

The other get method. Accept the book with concatenated name author.

# Testing

![[Pasted image 20250227104431.png]]

Requesting the vendor specific media type returns an error, 406, because the API, at the moment, only support application/json as an output format. 

![[Pasted image 20250227104526.png]] 

To fix that, add the produces attribute.

![[Pasted image 20250227104554.png|center|450]]
![[Pasted image 20250227104719.png|center|450]]


>[!important] Produces vs custom attribute
>The produces attribute sets the media type that is acceptable to be handle to the response. The custom attribute is a constraint that ensures the routing is done correctly. 

Now works.

![[Pasted image 20250227104758.png]]

But the documentation is still not working.

![[Pasted image 20250227104820.png|center|450]]


# The header is important
Detail, the first argument of the custom attribute is the header to inspect, in the case of a GET method, the important header is the Accept.

![[Pasted image 20250227104110.png]]

But in the case of a POST action is the content type. Remember [[23.9 Using vendor specific media type on input#^84fbcc|this note]].
