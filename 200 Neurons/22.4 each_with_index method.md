[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

## With arrays
Provides the functionality of two block variables, the first is the value the second is the index within the array. The regular each only provides that functionality with hashes. 

```ruby
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "strawberry", "pineapple"]

fruits.each_with_index { |fruit, index| puts fruit if index.even? }

#=> apple
#=> strawberry
#=> ["apple", "banana", "strawberry", "pineapple"]
```

The method returns the original array of elements.
