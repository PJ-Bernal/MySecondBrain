The next action method is get city; the repo interface offer a method to get city async giving the option to the consumer of the api to include or not a poi.

First, add that as a parameter to the method. then add async, await, and task to the method signature.

# Managing the responses
## When nothing is found

## Mapping the results of the get city async method
The return value of city needs to be mapped to a city without poi dto, or city dto. 

Add a mapper to the city entity (that's the return type of calling the get city async method), to a city dto.

And then use the mapper function to execute the mapping. In this image, if the poi are included, the return type is mapped to a city dto, if not, then is mapped to a city without poi dto.

## Adjusting the return type of the action method
Right now, the action method is returning a single type, when the implementation is returning several responses (a not found, an two oks), therefore, change from action result to I action result.

# Testing when the method is using a bool parameter
To pass a bool parameter add ? and then the parameter name with its value.

# Failed mapping
The above mapping fails because the city dto includes points of interest, and the city entity don't. Therefore, the mapped don't know how to map the poi. 

This require a new profile that will map from the entity to the model of poi.

After the mapping, everything is ok.

# Two more example
This code will be to return the poi of a city an get one specific poi.

First, inject the repo and the mapper into the poi controller.

This is the og class.

This is before adding the mapper and the repo.
![[Pasted image 20250127082632.png]]


The first step is always call the repo to get the data from the db.

![[Pasted image 20250127082720.png]]



Thet get poi for city async method don't check if the city exists or not. However, the get city async return null if a city doesn't exists, but this will return a city object, that is not really needed in this case, the code only need to check if the city exists or not, it doesn't need a whole object. 

![[Pasted image 20250127083033.png]]


So is better to create a method inside of the city repo to check if the city exist or not; the anysyn method will return true or false depending if the city exists or not. 

![[Pasted image 20250127083249.png]]

After crating the method in the city info repo, add it to the interface. 

![[Pasted image 20250127083319.png]]

Back to the controller, first add the method to check if the city exists or dont.

![[Pasted image 20250127083426.png]]

The simply map and return.
