The Api controller attribute is responsible that bad request response is return when the model state is invalid. Meaning, I don't have to create a unit test for bad request.

In the case I can't use the api controller attribute, the bad request won't be return automatically. This is what this note is about. 

# Controller without the attribute
Start with creating a controller class that don't use the api controller attribute.

This controller has a single action method.

# Creating the test
This test will check when invalid input is provided to the method, a bad request is return.

In this case, the test don't require actual functionality on the service or the mapper, so create only the instances.

The action parameter expects an internal employee for creating dto.

So to make the model invalid, pass invalid values. Detail first name is required, but in the test is empty.  However, this test is isolated, meaning the model binder is not going to execute. Meaning, this won't result in an invalid model state.

In reality the values passed when creating an instance in the test, doesn't matter.

To make the model invalid, add an error to it.

Then act and assert.
