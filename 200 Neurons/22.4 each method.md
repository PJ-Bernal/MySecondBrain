[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

## each on arrays
Calling each on an array will iterate through that array and will yield each element to a code block, where a task can be performed:

```ruby
friends = ['Sharon', 'Leo', 'Leila', 'Brian', 'Arun']

friends.each { |friend| puts "Hello, " + friend }

#=> Hello, Sharon
#=> Hello, Leo
#=> Hello, Leila
#=> Hello, Brian
#=> Hello, Arun

#=> ["Sharon", "Leo", "Leila", "Brian" "Arun"]
```

Here `{ }` is a block whose code run for each element in the array. Then between `| |` is the block variable (it can hold any name) which is the element of the array the block is currently iterating over; in the first iteration its valur is 'Sharon', then 'Leo', etc. 

>[!important] If the block need more than one line
>I need to switch to `do...end`. 
>```ruby
>my_array = [1, 2]
>
>my_array.each do |num|
>  num *= 2
>  puts "The new number is #{num}."
>end
>
>#=> The new number is 2.
>#=> The new number is 4.
>
>#=> [1, 2]
>
>```

## each on hashes
Each iteration will yield both the key and value individually or together (as an array) to the block depending on how you define your block variable.

```ruby
my_hash = { "one" => 1, "two" => 2 }

my_hash.each { |key, value| puts "#{key} is #{value}" }

one is 1
two is 2
#=> { "one" => 1, "two" => 2}

my_hash.each { |pair| puts "the pair is #{pair}" }

the pair is ["one", 1]
the pair is ["two", 2]
#=> { "one" => 1, "two" => 2}

```

## each return value
`each` returns the original array or hash unless a mutator methods within the code block was use.
