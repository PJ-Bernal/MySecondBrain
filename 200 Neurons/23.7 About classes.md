# Classes as custom types
Classes represent a model/structure with its functionalities and properties. Classes are reference (custom) types. Custom types and classes are not the same (So while classes create custom types, not all custom types are classes.). 

Almost all source code live inside of a class. And objects from different classes can interact with each other. 

Classes use memory-based equality, check [[23.7 Records#Value-based equality|this note]] to remember. 
# About struct and records
Similar to a class, with specific properties. Records, introduced in C# 9.0, are a new custom type; similar to classes with specific things. 
# What is class
A class is language construct that represents a blueprint of an object, with different kind of members, like fields, methods, constructors, etc. 

# Methods and classes
Methods are considered class members, therefore, they can't be write outside of a class. The only exception to this, are the methods within the entry point file as top-level methods, which under the hood, are wrapped inside of the Main class
