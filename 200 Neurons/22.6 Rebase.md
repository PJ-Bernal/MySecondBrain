Rebase is a way to 'update' the master branch with commits from other branch.


>[!warning] For squash, renames, joins, etc.
>Make a squash with an interactive rebase isn't recommended with commits that already have been pushed. 
## Standard rebase

It's recommended to apply rebase changes if they won't affect external repositories. 


## Interactive rebase
Use the command `git rebase -i HEAD~*`; `HEAD` can represent any commit via hash or HEAD, and `*` represents the number of commits that will be moved (in the same extracted order from the branch) to the temporary area and rebase (in the same extracted order).

Interactive rebase is useful for: organize commits, correct commits' messages, join commits (for example I did several small commits that could be join in one 'big' commit) and split commits (when I submit a big commit but would like to split it up).

## Example
![[Pasted image 20240118105924 1.png|center|600]]

Detail the 'rama-misiones' branch hasn't been joined to the main branch, and the last two commits (on the main branch) should have been committed to the 'rama-misiones' branch. 

To solve this I can create a simple merge, positioning the HEAD on the rm branch, and merge it with HEAD. Another solution is using a rebase. 

To begin with the rebase, I have to be located in the branch I'm going to affect `git checkout rm`, rm in this case. Now, the rebase will move the two commits from the rm branch to the temporal area, and then place them (in the same order) at the end of the main branch.

`git rebase master`, and all is done. Detail, the last commit in the main branch was 'volcan' and Git is showing that indicating 'master'.

Now, at this very moment, I still have the two branches, rm and master (as the image shows), however, they were glue into one. To ease workflow, I could join the two branches with a merch like this: `git checkout master` and `git merge rm`.

![[Pasted image 20240123082408 1.png]]
Detail now the master and rm branches are join, and Git did a fast-forward. Finally I can delete the rm with `git branch -d rm`

## Squash
One useful case for rebase is to join commits into one, like in this case, in which the last commits are related. 

![[Pasted image 20240123082930 1.png]]

Use `git rebase -i 'starting commit to rebase'`, the `-i` flag refers to interactive commit. So, `git rebase -i HEAD~4` in this case I'm going to involve the last four commits, remember I can put a hash instead of HEAD, so `git reabse -i dd8937e~4`

The IDE opens a new window with a lot of functionalities, for example I can change the commit name here. In this case, to squash to commits, just write s instead of pick, and Git will squash the current commit name with s with the last one.

>
>To squash two commits, change 'pick' for 's' for squash and Git will squash the current commit with the last one. Don't change the third commit to 's' or Git will squash the second, third and fourth. 

Now, save the window, close it and another window will pop-up to change the squash commit names. Git will populate the squash commit with the message of the last commit.

## Reword
To change the commit message, located on the first interactive window, change the `pick` word for `r`, for reword. Don't change the commit name [[22.6 Rebase#^6030c9|here]]. The edit the name, save and close the windows. 

The reword only change the commit's name, no the author. 

## Edit
[[22.6 Basic Git workflow#Fallback to previous commit / Checkout|This]], discards all the changes but I want to fall back the changes in only one file with ` git checkout -- 'filename'`. 

![[Pasted image 20240123092411 1.png|center|350]]

To break apart a commit, for example, if I commit the two files 'misiones' and 'villanos', use `git rebase -i HEAD~3`, then change pick for e. 

![[Pasted image 20240123093014 1.png|center|350]]

Now, after this point, Git will be in rebase status, Git is not in a branch, is in the middle of a rebase. 

![[Pasted image 20240123093155 1.png|center|450]]

>Now, I have to finish the rebase. I'm not required to, but Git will be in this rebase state until I tell him `git rebase --continue`. (this is like a git reset soft).

>[!multi-column]
>
>Now, I can reset the last commit with `git reset HEAD^`. With this command, I'll be in the exact point in which I made the changes to the files prior to make the commit! And the changes are still there.

Now I can commit separately the files as usual, but detail the Head and the main branch are in different locations, and this is because I'm still in the rebase mode. 
![[Pasted image 20240123094325 1.png|center|450]]

Once the rebase is done with `git rebase --continue`, the rebase mode finish. Detail! How the last commit made (commits) is deleted and now, only appear the last two edited commits and the head is not in the main branch. 

>If for some reason Git says 'the head is detached the master' I can solve that with `git checkout master` to move the head to the main branch.
