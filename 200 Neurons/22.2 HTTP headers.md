[[12.2 The internet]]
## HTTP headers
Headers allow the client and server to send additional information during the HTTP request/response cycle. They are colon-separated key-value pairs (`Content-Type: text/html`) sent in plain text. The browser inspect shows more clearly those headers than Linux. 

In the browser inspector, headers are visible by clicking every request.

### Request headers
Give more information about the client and the resource to be fetched. Send by the client to the server. Some important request headers are:

-|-|-
|Host | Domain of the server | Host: www.reddit.com|
|Accept-Language | List of acceptable languages | Accept-Language: en-US, en;q=0.8 |
| User-Agent | String that identifies the client | User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/38.0.2125.101 Safari/537.36| 
| Connection | Type of connection the client would prefer | Connection: keep-alive |

### Response headers
Headers that provide meta information about the response data being sent back from the server to the client. Remember [[22.2 HTTP request methods#^d00e12|the Location response header]]. 

Header Name | Description | Example

| Server | Name of the server |Server:thin 1.5.0 codename Knife |
| Location | Notify client of new resource location. | Location:https://www.github.com/login| 
| Content-Type | The type of data the response contains. | Content-Type:text/html; charset=UTF-8 |

### Representation headers
Describe the representation of the resource send in the message body: `Content-Type: application/json`. 

### Payload headers
Describe the payload of the message, its total size: `Content-Length: 348`.

### Custom headers

[Some](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Forbidden_header_name) HTTP headers can't be modify by the code.
