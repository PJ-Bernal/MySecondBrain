[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

`break` in loops have the same use as in switch statements, a break statement will immediately exit the loop and make the browser move on to any code that follows it.

For example, I want to loop through an array and stop as soon as I find the desire information.

```javascript
const contacts = [
  "Chris:2232322",
  "Sarah:3453456",
  "Bill:7654322",
  "Mary:9998769",
  "Dianne:9384975",
];
const para = document.querySelector("p");
const input = document.querySelector("input");
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const searchName = input.value.toLowerCase();
  input.value = "";
  input.focus();
  para.textContent = "";
  for (const contact of contacts) {
    const splitContact = contact.split(":");
    if (splitContact[0].toLowerCase() === searchName) {
      para.textContent = `${splitContact[0]}'s number is ${splitContact[1]}.`;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (para.textContent === "") {
    para.textContent = "Contact not found.";
  }
});
```

Detail the loop only returns one element and the stops. 

>[!important]
>Break only breaks the inner loop, the loop is within, so I if I have two loops nested, break won't break of both, but the inner uniquely. 
## Infinite loops and break
The combination “infinite loop + break as needed” is great for situations when a loop’s condition must be checked not in the beginning or end of the loop, but in the middle or even in several places of its body.

```javascript
let sum = 0;
while (true) {
  let value = +prompt("Enter a number", '');
  if (!value) break; // (*)
  sum += value;
}
alert( 'Sum: ' + sum );
```

For example, in this case the script will stop only when the user type either 0 or nothing.
