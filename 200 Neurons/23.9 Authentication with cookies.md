When the authentication is verify, a cookie is created to maintain user authentication across HTTP requests. 

# Cookie schema

This is some information a cookie may contain. 

Claims identity is an identity object that contains: claims which represent user data like the role, username, etc. And the authentication type.

The claims identity are contain within a claims principal, meaning, the principal can have multiple claims identities. For example, if an user is able to log in through facebook or google, different claims identities can be added to the principal.

Authentication properties is a serialization of claims principal and the authentication properties with some defined information. 

Don't confuse the cookie with the session identified used to maintain sessions state. 
# Cookies and the host domain
Once authenticated, the cookies are encrypted and then send back to the browser. Then, on each request to the host domain that created the cookie, the browser will automatically send the cookie with the request. 

Detail the cookie is send to the host domain that create the cookie, meaning, the scheme (https://), subdomain (www) and domain name (myapi.com), with the second level domain name (myapi), and the top level domain name (.com), matter and must match to be able to send the cookie. 

Once the cookie is on the .NET app, the cookie is validated, decrypted, and using the claims principal, the claims are created. In .NET Core, the claims principal are validated by the request/response pipeline, like the authentication and authorization middleware. 

In the API the claims principal is accessible via `HttpContext.User`. 

# The browser and cookies
As mentioned earlier, the browser only sends the cookie when the same domain, meaning, if the API needs to be access by consumer from a different domain, the cookie won't be send and consumer can't authenticate.  

There are scenarios where's no cookie like mobile apps, post man, http files. In those cases, I must use API keys or tokens.  This means, cookies are only a good choice when the consumer and the api are within the same domain.
