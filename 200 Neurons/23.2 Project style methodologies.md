[[13.2 Project management]]

The project style selected dictates how much information will be available to design the project. These are the most common methodologies (listed from having the most detail requirements to less requirements).
## Waterfall
Oldest methodology. All the requirements are gather and analyzed first in detail, then the development process runs until the product is finish, finally it's deployed. The process runs from start to finish with no deviation or looping back.

### Development techniques
Both techniques attempt to combat the lack of feedback. 
>[!info]- Prototyping 
>Prototype show to the client for early feedback (this is a disadvantage)proof concept, trying to reduce risk. Usually is not the best with the habit of becoming the application.

>[!info]- Personas
>Extremely detailed faked user profiles to gather no real user feedback, not the best practice.

### Advantages
- Easy to budget: the whole project was designed up front, so it's easy to estimate costs.
- Easy to manage: no deviations or decisions other than move to the next phase. 
### Disadvantages
- Rigidity: no space for change in requirements, so, no allowance for missed requirements.
- No feedback: the whole solution is provided at the end.
### When to use
Old and outdate methodology, useful in not many cases, but: small duration projects (that can finish before any change can be made), no developer collaboration or the collaboration between teams is difficult, low or null requirements changing, need for a precise budget. 


## V-Model
Waterfall deviation with test focus (planned in parallel with each task); better final product than waterfall but less response to changes.

### Advantages
- Easy to budget: the whole project was designed up front, so it's easy to estimate costs.
- Easy to manage: no deviations or decisions other than move to the next phase. 
- Requirements are validated before coding.
### Disadvantages
- More rigidity than waterfall; zero space for change in requirements, so, no allowance for missed requirements. Also, every change must revisit testing and all designing. 
- No feedback
### When to use
- Often sed in safety-critical systems (aero space and defense systems).

## Iterative / incremental
During the lifecycle, the requirements could change, making closer those requirements to its actual coding. Each iteration runs its little waterfall (rapids). Incremental - Break down a project into smaller deliverable parts Iterative - run through many development cycles in a circle until we've delivered what they want.

### Development techniques
- Go ugly early: the highest risk features are developed first, allowing for early reworking. 

### Advantages
- Responsive to change: all the requirements from the start to an specific iteration are attended.
- Work can be split up: project is break into smaller parts. 
- Feedback: each iteration recieves feedback.
### Disadvantages
- Budgeting is harder, as all the requirements are missed since the beginning of the project.
- Requirements for the iteration are up front: cannot respong to change inside an iteration, so iteration must be kept as small as possible.
### When to use
- Projects of longer duration, 1 iteration could be a month duration.
- More concern of product viability than cost.
- Developer collaboratoin is difficult.
- Risk of changing requirements.

## Agile
Agile refers to many formats of development (one of its core ideas follows the iterative / incremenetal methodology) The idea behinf agile is that my requirements are wrong and I'll fail. So, just fail faster, cleaner and with less damage, to fall again and every time 'better'.

Formats of agile are about improving team communication and collaboration to get a working feature in front of the requrester as fast as possible, so it can ask for changes begore it's to late. Iterations is agile are much faster, they usually be contained in a major planning cycle called a spring. Each iteration has a deployable and reviewable software at the end, to gather feedback.

Here is a clear difference between older incremenetal formats (first series) and agile.

### Development techniques
- Scrum: prescribed set of work ownership and team communication structure. Commonly implemented even outside the agile methodology 
- Lean: 
- Continuos integration
- Extreme programming 
- Test driven development (TDD)
### Advantages
- Responsive to change
- Work can be split
- Business priorities: usually the business users control the order of work.
### Disadvantages
- Budgeting is harder
- Communicatino problems
### Where to use
- The project is if longer duration.
- More concern in product viability than cost.
- Team communication is high and requesters are engaged.
