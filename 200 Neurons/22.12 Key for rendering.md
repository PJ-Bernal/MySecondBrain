[[12.12 React|React]]

Each array item must have a key (string or a number) to be identify among other items in the array. 

>Elements using `map()` always need keys. 

Keys help React which array item each component corresponds to, useful when the items are sorted, deleted or inserted. SO, if possible mark each item with a key.
