# About the notes - project
Cookies usually require a front end where the user can input they username and password. 

When the log in button is pressed, the Login action method is executed.

The project also contains an api controller for the claims. There's only one action method that returns the list of claims of the current user. This is the endpoint to secure with a cookie.

# Add services in program
The og code.

Add the `AddAuthentication()` service, passing the scheme.  Detail this argument is a string constant which that specify the scheme name. 

The scheme name is an identifier for handling authentication, meaning, I can have multiple ways to authenticate users within the same app, and each scheme can have its own settings and configuration. 

This means the name of the scheme, the string constant (avoid hard-coding), is a key component of an authentication scheme.

The next component is the handler that perform the authentication logic by processing authentication request, validate credentials and create authentication tickets. This handler needs cookies, so chain `.AddCookies()` to authentication.

Then, the options object allows to configure the behavior of the scheme. One configuration is setting the login path and the logout path.

Login and logout path are properties that specify the paths the user will be redirected for login and logout. For example if the user attempts to access a resource that requires authentication, it will be redirected to the log in path.

## Adding the middleware
Then add the authentication and authorization middleware to the pipeline.  The typical place to place both middleware are after use routing.

## Adding the attributes on controllers 
Add the `Authorize` attribute to the controllers or action methods that required an authenticated user.

# Writing the cookie in the controller
The og code.

![[Pasted image 20250306082323.png]]

First, create a list of claims for the user. In reality I should have a repo, go to the db, validate credentials and get the user info. This notes will be using hard-coded data.

![[Pasted image 20250306082444.png|center|350]]

Then create the claims identity and the claims principal.

![[Pasted image 20250306082818.png|center|350]]

Create the authentication properties, those will indicate when the cookie expires, whether it can be refreshed, etc.

![[Pasted image 20250306083104.png|center|350]]


To attach those claims to the cookie use the sign-in async method of the http context, using one overload that accepts the scheme and the claims principal, and the authentication properties.

This is an async method so add async and task to the action method signature.

![[Pasted image 20250306083305.png|center|350]]

# Implementing the logout
Add the authenticate attribute. And use the sign out method, passing the schema.

![[Pasted image 20250306083452.png|center|350]]

# Testing the cookie
After log in, a new cookie appear `AspNetcore.Cookies`.

![[Pasted image 20250306083537.png]]

After log out, the cookie must be gone.
