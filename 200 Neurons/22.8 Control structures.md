[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

## elseif
Use `elseif` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false. The difference with using `else` is that else is always executed when the condition is false, `elseif` check again a condition. 
## elseif vs else if
They work the same but within HTML I have to use `elseif` not `else if`. Gio uses `elseif` always. 

## Control structures within HTML
There are several ways to use control structures within HTML.

>[!error] Avoid this
>>[!multi-column]
>>
>>- Don't embed HTML within PHP
>>Strong tag is within PHP, creating only one big PHP block.
>>

>
>>[!multi-column]
>>- HTML is not within PHP, but the blocks aren't consistent.
>>Another possible solution is to have an opening and closing PHP tag for each is statement.

>However, the following syntax enhance readability and order. Instead of curly braces, use a colon and the closing PHP tag. At the end, the whole control structure must be closed with a specific tag.
>%% %%
>Here the HTML is **not** embedded onto the PHP.
