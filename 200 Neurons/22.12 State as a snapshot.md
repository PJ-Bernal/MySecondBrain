[[12.12 React|React]]

This note is closely related to other one, it talks about updating the state in renders between arrow functions, see that note and bundle to this one. 

Setting a state, request a re-render from React (this is done by changing the state or the parent component trigger a re-render).
## Rending takes a snapshot in time
Rendering calls my component (the function implementation) and the return statement (the JSX) from that function, is a snapshot of the UI in time with props, event handlers and local variables, all calculated using the state at the time of the render. React updates the screen to match the snapshot.

So, when react re-renders it calls the function again, it returns a new JSX snapshot and react updates the screen to match the snapshot.

As disclosed in other notes, state prevails between snapshots, it doesn't disappear after the function returns, meaning react will always give the state for a called component, for that particular render. 

Then, the component returns the snapshot of the UI with fresh props and even handlers, all using the state for **that** render. Remember, the `setState()` with a primitive argument queues **one single** re-rendering cycle. 

### Setting the state with a primitive value
Setting the state this way only changes for the **next** render. The value of `number` is still 0 event after the first is called. In **this** render's event handler the state value is always 0, so the state is set to 1 three times.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}

// In other words: Since the number state variable is 0 for this render, its event handler looks like this:
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(0 + 1);
  setNumber(0 + 1);
  setNumber(0 + 1);
}}>+3</button>

// For the next render, number is 1, so that render’s click handler looks like this:
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(1 + 1);
  setNumber(1 + 1);
  setNumber(1 + 1);
}}>+3</button>
```

### State over time - with arrow functions
A state variable’s value never changes within a render, even if its event handler’s code is asynchronous. This means, the state is already know and determine when rendering. 

In this example, even though there's a timeout for the alert, the state was 0, so the alert shows 0 even though the button shows 5. 

```jsx
export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 5);
        setTimeout(() => {
          alert(number);
        }, 3000);
      }}>+5</button>
    </>
  )
}
```
