## See variables within scope - autos window
It's a tab at the bottom called Autos, if not,  debug -> windows -> Autos.

This window gives an overview of all variables that are in the current scope of the breakpoint. 

For example, the breakpoint is a step into (because is a yellow arrow) in line 136, on that point, the window shows a number of hours variable, and this, that refers to the object that is invoking the method, in this case, bethany. 

Expand `this` on the autos window to inspect all the fields of the object in that execution time.

Moving one step, to line 137, now the autos shows the number of hours property.
