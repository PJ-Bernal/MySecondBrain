Filtering (precise) in API terms take into an account the predicate `https://host/api/cities?name=Col` `name=Col` is the predicate. Searching wide) use a direct value to search, goes after `?` `searchQuery=Colombia`, in this case, is a decision of the api which fields search for that value. 
# Filter resources
## Adding the filter parameter
The og code
![[Pasted image 20250127165307.png]]

Filter use a method parameter, so add name parameter as a nullable type. name is not a complex type, collection and don't match any parameter name from the route template, hence, because of the api controller attribute, that parameter will be bound the as a query string. 

However, for readability I could add the from query attribute, but is not needed.

### When the query string parameter don't have the same name as the predicate
The from query attribute has a property called `Name` that allows to bound the parameter with what ever is the predicate use for the filtering, when they are named different. For example, in this case, the query string (the predicate) is `filteronname` do this.

If the query string and the parameter have the same name, that's not required.

## Modify the repository
Detail the code has one method when nothing is passed, and another with a name parameter.

First, check if the passed name is empty. If it is, return all cities, order by name. Otherwise, trim rid the leading and trailing spaces and return a name variable. Then use a where clause to filter, then orde and finally, call to list async to execute the query into the db.

Then add the method to the repo interface.

## How to check how the query is being executed in the db
Modify the app settings json, to see all commands starting with level information. Add the db.command: information, this is only for development.

Detail the request was send to the db.

# Searching
The og code

## Adding the search parameter
As filter, a parameter is needed.
![[Pasted image 20250127171918.png]]

Filtering and searching can work together, therefore, the get cities async method should use the searching parameter as well.

## Update the repo interface
![[Pasted image 20250127174629.png]]

## Update the method implementation
Only if both the filter and search queries are null, return the full list of cities.
![[Pasted image 20250127174746.png]]

After that, the method can work with both queries, only one or none. Because the db will be in charge of this process, there's a need to cast `DbSet<City>` into `IQueriable<City`. This allow to use where clauses to filtering and searching if needed.

### Adding the filter
![[Pasted image 20250127182503.png|center|350]]

### Adding the searching
Searching depends on architecture requirements. Often is a full text search or a simpler one. This example will use a where clause that will return any city from which name or description is contained in the search query.

The last null is a null check on description to avoid null reference issues. 

![[Pasted image 20250127182801.png]]

### Return the collection
Order and return the collection after calling the to list async. 

![[Pasted image 20250127182910.png]]

## Testing
Testing just filter.

![[Pasted image 20250127182954.png]]

 Testing the search query of all cities that contain the as part of their string fields, any field, in this case, `the cathedral`. 

![[Pasted image 20250127183141.png]] 

Searching is casing sensitive. The produce more results. 

![[Pasted image 20250127183308.png]]

Testing both

# An alternative approach
Use a method that retrieves a list of cities from a repository, applies some filtering, and maps the results to a DTO. This is a bad practice because all cities with the name query are fetch from the db, after that will list would be searched in memory, meaning a lot of unnecessary cities are fetched from the db.
