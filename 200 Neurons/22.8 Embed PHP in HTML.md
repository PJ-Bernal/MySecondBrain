## Embed PHP in HTML or embed HTML in PHP
>[!multi-column]

>Is a bad practice to embed HTML code within PHP code. Detail the editor highlight even the HTML tags as strings, so there is no HTML validation. 
%% %%
>So, the editor will parse the HTML code as a PHP string and not as a HTML code.
>
>```php
>`<?php 
>if(true){
>echo "<p>Some HTML text.</p>";
>}
>?>

>So, is better to embed PHP in HTML by respecting the HTML code adding a opening and closing tag for each PHP statement. In this case, the if statement has two parts, the `if(true) {` and the `}`, thus every statement's component has opening and closing tags.
>%% %%
>The editor now parses the HTML code as it is. 
>
>```php
>`<?php if(true){ ?>
><p>Some HTML text.</p>
><?php } ?>
>```

>[!example]- Embed PHP within HTML
This is how to embed PHP within HTML, detail the HTML tags are identified by the editor and only the require PHP elements are enclosed within tags.

>[!example]- Leaving part of the PHP statement outside the PHP tags
>Here, the `{` is outside the closing tag, so it'll be parse as HTML code, creating an error. 
>```php
>`<?php if(true) ?> { 
>        `<p>Some HTML tfghnhgfext.</p>
>`<?php } ?>
>```

>[!warning] PHP blocks
>The `<p>` tag is not between a par of opening and closing tags (it surrounded by the tags), so I could think is being ignored by the PHP parse, but it doesn't because is within a PHP block, so is part of the PHP script. 

### Optional HTML attributes with PHP
Because of parser functionality, in this example is ignoring the code is in between an opening HTML tag.

```PHP
<html>
<body>
<p<?php if ($highlight): ?> class="highlight"<?php endif;?>>This is a paragraph.</p>`
...
```

Detail the block starts with `Ã¬f ($highlight):` and ends with `endif;`, thus, the `class="highlight"` is part of the block an not ignored by the PHP parser. 

If highlight is true the code will be 

```html
<html>
<body>
<p class="highlight">This is a paragraph.</p>
...
```

If the code is false, the result parsed code will be.

```html
<html>
<body>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
...
```
