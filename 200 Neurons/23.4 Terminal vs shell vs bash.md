## Terminal vs shell vs bash
>[!info] Terminal
>Window (or `console`) that allows users to write commands and see the output by interacting with an operating system through a Command-Line Interface. 

>[!info] Shell
>Program that provides an interface whose primary purpose is to read commands (some are built-in) and run other programs (its capabilities include: script creation, automaticity, etc.) There are different shells for UNIX (`zsh` and `fish`), the Ubuntu's default is `bash`.
>>The unix shell is both, a command-line interface (CLI) and a scripting language.

>[!info] Bash
>Most common UNIX shell, includes advanced functionality such as command-line editing, job control, shell scripting capabilities, and support for a wide range of utilities and tools.

A terminal is an application that doesn’t do much more but provide a window to run another program, called a “shell”. A shell is a text-based program, so it does not have a window, and thus needs the terminal to be run on your graphical user interface.

A shell is an interactive program that waits for you to type a command and hit enter (or “return”). It will then run the command, display any output, and then, again, sit and wait for you to type the next command.
