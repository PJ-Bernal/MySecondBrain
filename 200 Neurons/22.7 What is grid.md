For one-dimensional layouts Flex is enough as it offers a way to set up elements in columns or rows. Now, for two dimensional the `flex-wrap` property allow to wrap things onto a new line.

## What is grid?
Grid place elements in a two-dimensional layout right, though it can be use to array one-dimensional layouts as well; so I can start with one row, and then add more.
