[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

 # About http files

VS has an HTTP file editor to test ASP.NET Core API from the UI. 

# Adding an http file
Right click on project, add, new item, search http file, and name it `<project name>.http`
# Describing the URL
Then, use the @ symbol to define variables to describe the URL parts, like the schema, hostname and port,
# Creating a request
Then make the request. To use a http variable use double {{, then run the api without debugging and press on send request to try the request.

To create another request use ###â€ž meaning, the next line will be another request

## Including headers
Write each header immediately after the request line

### Request with a request body
When a body is required to the request, put the request url, then the headers, leave a space, and then the body. Detail I got a 201.

TEST THIS because at the moment of the tutorial is not supported. I name a request with @name, then in the second request I grab the id, and paste it into the get request, but this fails FOR NOW.
