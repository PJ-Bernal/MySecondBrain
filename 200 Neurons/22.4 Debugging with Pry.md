[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]


## Install and open Pry
`Pry` is a library with embedded features for debugging, it provides an interactive REPL (read, eval print, loop) while the program is running. First, install it with: `gem install pry`. Then execute the `pry` command that will open a new session like opening the `irb` in the shell. 

## Use Pry
For debugging I have to `require "pry"` and insert a `binding.pry` in the source code, like this:

```ruby
# preparation.rb
require "pry"

a = [1, 2, 3]
a << 4
binding.pry     # execution will pause here, allowing you to inspect all objects
puts a
```

When the program gets reaches `binding.pry` it will open a new `pry` session instead of moving to the next line of code; given the opportunity to inspect the variables and objects to identify bugs. I'm literally pausing the script execution to inspect the state of all variables and objects. 

To continue with the script, scape pry with ctrl + D.
