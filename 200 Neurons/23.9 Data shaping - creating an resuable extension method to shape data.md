# About data shapping
This principle allows the consumer to choose the fields of the resource representation that have to be returned. In this example, only the id and name.

Data shaping relies on the fields query string parameter, which is comma separated. This principle improve performance a lot, image a resource with 50 fields, but the consumer needs only 2. 

Like filtering and sorting, the field selection is on the resource, not the entity. So a field of age is valid, but dob is not. 

# Creating a reusable extension method to shape data
The og code.

According to the method signature, I don't need to necessarily return an IEnum of Author dto, but an IEnum of a new object, that contains only the requested fields, meaning I need to dynamically create an object at runtime starting from the author dto using dynamically typed object, using the ExpandObject.

It represents an object whose members can be dynamically added or removed at runtime. So the extension method to create is a method that extens `IEnumerable<T>`, accepts the requested consumer fields and returns an IEnum of dynamic typed objects, expan objects, with only the requested fields.

Create a class for the extensio method in helpers, detail the static on the class to allow that class to extend.

That method should return an IEnum of expand object, that work on an IEnum of some type and takes the fields.

Then, if no fields are requested, all fields should be return. Use reflection to fetch all public and instance properties

If the fields have been inputted.

Then run through all the objects in the source list, in this examples are author dtos, create a new expand object. At the end, add that field to the expando object, in this case, is casted to a dictionary string object., the key of the dictionaty holds the property nae while the value of the dictionary holds the property value
