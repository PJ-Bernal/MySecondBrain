[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

# Generic interfaces
Add the type parameters after the interface keyword. T in an interface is the type a property/method can be used or return.

When using the instance, I'm telling the compiler the interface Inventory will be using ONLY objects of type Book.

```ts
interface Pair<T, U> {
    first: T;
    second: U;
}

// Usage
let pair1: Pair<number, string> = { first: 1, second: "one" };
let pair2: Pair<string, boolean> = { first: "yes", second: true };
```

# Generic classes

For this example, this class will store the user favorite related items, not only movies,

Now, the same class is being use with other type.

## Generic without constriants
When creating a class, I can use it with 'any' type, however, that doesn't mean I can use that type as is inside of my class implementation.

For example, this methods want to access the title property of the item, but items, right now, is T, and T could be any type. Therefore, without generic constraints, my class at the moment can use properties that are present in all types.

# Generic constraints
Generics are more powerful when constraint, to allow classes and functions work with a subset of all types. Constraints describes the pass that may be passed as a type parameter, this is why generics are most often implemented as interfaces that describe the type used as a type parameter.

To create a constrain over the type use the `extends` on `T` to force T extends an interface, hence, any T type use in the class must implement the catalog number property.

no errors now.

![[Pasted image 20250218105422.png]]

Now the class is more type safety, the error here is generated because number doesn't have a property called title.

![[Pasted image 20250218105521.png]]

This works because Documentary objects have a title property.
