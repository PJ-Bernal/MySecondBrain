[[13.9 ASP.NET Core Web API|ASP.NET Core Web API]]

The og code. Get authors doesn't return a list of authors dto.

![[Pasted image 20250206133615.png]]

It returns an IEnum of expando objects, a data shaped version of an author dto. 
![[Pasted image 20250206133641.png]]

Therefore, I can't extend that data shape object to the links property through a base class. But use an anonymous type approach.

# Implementation for one author
Add a class to models for links dto.

![[Pasted image 20250206133823.png]]

The og code.
![[Pasted image 20250206133840.png]]

Add a parameter that represents the links, that will be use in the response body. For that, create a helper method, that will need the author guid and the fields. 

![[Pasted image 20250206134009.png]]

Then create the links. If the field is null or white space, put the link the GET link. Now, when the api has an author, I can let the consumer to create a course for an author, then, my API can drive the consumer telling him what they is able to do. My code is deciding the functionality of the consumer. Detail `new(url, rel, method)`
![[Pasted image 20250206134058.png]]

Now, after getting the author, I want to drive the consumer telling him he can create a course if the author exists. Detail the links need the name of the action methods they are linking, so write a name for create a course.

![[Pasted image 20250206134543.png]]

Then, put the link for creating the course.

![[Pasted image 20250206134707.png]]

Then, once my code is finish telling the consumer how it can interact with the resource, then the code can show him how to navigate through the API from that resource. In this case, showing the consumer how to get the courses of an author.

So, again, name the respective method.

![[Pasted image 20250206134829.png]]

And add the link.

>[!important]
>This place, where I add links, I decide whether or not show a link base on business rules.

## Adding the links to the resource body
The og code.
