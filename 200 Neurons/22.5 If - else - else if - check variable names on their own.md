[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

JavaScript has the following conditional statements. 

>[!info]
>- Use `if` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
>- Use `else` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
>- Use `else if` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.
>- Use `switch` to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.

Writing if and else statements without parenthesis, is not a good practice. Also, always use curly braces to wrap the code block. 
## Else if
`else if` allows to chain several conditions for testing.

```javascript
if (_condition1_) {  
  //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (_condition2_) {  
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else if  (condition 3){  
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if all conditions are false
}
```

>[!example]
>```javascript
>if (time < 10) {  
  greeting = "Good morning";  
} else if (time < 20) {  
  greeting = "Good day";  
} else {  
  greeting = "Good evening";  
}
## About comparison operators
[[22.5 Data types - objects or data types -  primitives as objects - autoboxing#^cca767|Based on the truthy and falsely values]] I can test variables names on their own to test whether is true or exists.

```javascript
let shoppingDone = false;
let childsAllowance;

// We don't need to explicitly specify 'shoppingDone === true'
if (shoppingDone) {
  console.log(childsAllowance = 10);
} else {
  console.log(childsAllowance = 5);
}
// 5
```
