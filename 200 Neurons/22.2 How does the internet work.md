[[12.2 The internet|The internet]]
## A simple network
To connect several computers, each one is connected to a special computer called **router** that makes sure a message sent from a given computer arrives at the right destination computer. So, a message from computer A, goes to the router, to end in computer B.

## A network of networks
Connecting routers will create a network close what we call the Internet, but that is not enough. Now, to connect millions routers with the rest of the word requires a **modem**, that turns the information from any network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure.

Now, to send messages  between networks, the modem requires to be connected to a Internet Service Provider (ISP), which is a company that manager special routers that are linked together and also can access to other ISP's routers. 

So, the message is carried through the network of ISP networks to the destination networks.

## IP address 
Any computer linked to a network has a unique identity address called IP address (Internet Protocol); and when required, port numbers add more detail about how to communicate. Here is an example of an IP with a port number. 
```
192.168.0.1:1234
```

Computers can handle IP addresses, humans don't, that's why the domain-name was invented as a humane-readable name. 

For example, google.com is the domain name used on top of the IP address 142.250.190.78. _IP addresses can change over time._

## Internet and the web 
Internet is the technical infrastructure which allows billions of computers to be connected, some computers called Web Servers can send messages intelligible to web browser. The web is a service built on top of the infrastructure (there are other services such as email, and IRC).

## Web page
Document, written in HTML, that be displayed in a web browser such as Firefox, Chrome, etc. These are also often called "pages".

## Website
Collection of web pages and its resources, which are grouped and usually connected together in various ways, that share a unique domain name; there is usually a home page. 

>[!note] website vs web server
>Don't confuse _websites_ and _web servers_. For example, if you hear someone say, "My website is not responding", it actually means that the _web server_ is not responding and therefore the _website_ is not available.
## Web server
![[22.8 What is a server]]

## Browsers and search engine
- Browser: piece of software that retrieves and displays web pages. 
- Search engine: website that helps people find web pages from other websites.
