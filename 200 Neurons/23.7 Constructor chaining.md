[[13.7 C Sharp|C#]]
# About chained constructors
Constructors have a unique combination of parameters, types, and order thus, each one could have a different way to instantiate an object. This is the same as [[23.7 How C sharp grabs the correct method -  method overloading#Method overloading|method overloading]]. 

When a pair of constructor are in charge of instantiate an object using almost the same number, type and order of arguments, they are candidates to be chained constructors. One of them should be considered the 'main' constructor, and the others invoke it using `this`, which is in charge of call the type of constructor with the appropriate number, type and order parameters. 

The right image shows constructor chaining, and the left is the hard-coded version. Detail, "both images are the same", but chaining is a better practice.

Of course, if a constructor is mean to instantiate in another way an object, lets say using another properties, then that constructor is not part of this chain. 
## How the chain works
```c#
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public string Address { get; set; }

    // Base constructor with all parameters
    public Person(string name, int age, string address)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
        Address = address;
    }

    // Chains to the first constructor, providing a default address
    public Person(string name, int age) : this(name, age, "Unknown")
    {
    }

    // Chains to the second constructor, providing a default age
    public Person(string name) : this(name, 0)
    {
    }
}
```

When creating an instance, the compiler will match the arguments' amount, types and order with the appropriate constructor (the one that has the same amount of parameters and types). Then it'll look at the `this` declaration and will **call** the appropriate constructor that have the exact type and number of arguments. This continues until it reaches the main constructor.

The called constructor must tell the compiler the not used argument's default value of the chained constructor. The first constructor tell the compiler, using `this`, the default value of email, that is used in the second constructor. 

```c#
// Main constructor
    public Employee(string first, string last, string em, DateTime bd, double rate, string dept)
    {
        firstName = first;
        lastName = last;
        email = em;
        birthDay = bd;
        hourlyRate = rate;
        department = dept;
        Console.WriteLine("Third constructor executed");
    }
    
// First chained constructor
    public Employee(string first, string last) 
        : this(first, last, "default@email.com")  // Calls the second constructor
    {
        Console.WriteLine("First constructor executed");
    }

// Second chained constructor
    public Employee(string first, string last, string em) 
        : this(first, last, em, DateTime.Now, 0, "General")  // Calls the third constructor
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Second constructor executed");
    }

    
```
