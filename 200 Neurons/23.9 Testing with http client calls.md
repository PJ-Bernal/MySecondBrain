I can use a mock to avoid the actual api to api call.

Now, in that class, this method use another method that invokes an api.

# Creating the test
In this controller class.

![[Pasted image 20250305113653.png]]

This is the action method to test. Detail this action needs both the employee service and the promotion service.

So create the test class. First I need to create an instance of the controller class, this class needs and employee and a promotion service. 

So, to mock the employee service, I can start mocking the employee service interface. Then, looking at the controller implementation, this service is used to invoke the `FetchInteranlEmployeeAsync` method, so I need to set up that.

Then, looking into that method implementation, it needs a guid and it returns a internal employee, that why the `ReturnsAsync` of the setup returns that.

This internal employee is created by the constructor of another class. Detail this constructor create instance with the first name, last name, years in service, etc. In this case, the code is using two object initializers, for the suggested bonus and the Id.
