[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

Objects have two types of properties: ^d13498
1. Data properties: variables that hold any type of value and can be called using dot or bracket notation.
2. Accessor properties: functions that focus on get and set a value. Accessor properties act like a regular data property, see the image in using getter. 

To use getter and setter methods I can use the `get` or `set` keywords.

>The word after `get` or `set` is going to be a new property of the object. 

>[!question] Why use accessor properties?
>The advantages relies on the ability to access or set dynamically a variable instead of let the variable be a fix value.  


```js
let obj = {
  get propName() {
    // getter, the code executed on getting obj.propName
  },

  set propName(value) {
    // setter, the code executed on setting obj.propName = value
  }
};
```

>[!error]
> A property can be either an accessor (has get/set methods) or a data property (has a value), not both.

## Using getter
```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  surname: "Smith",
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;
  }
};

alert(user.fullName); // John Smith
```

Using getter allow to create a variable on the way, though I use the `get`. This reduce to copy-paste existing information. 

Getter variables, `fullname` in this case, can't be modified.

>[!important]
>Getter properties look like `fullName (...)` when console.dir, look the lazy getter first image. 

```js
let user = {
  get fullName() {
    return `...`;
  }
};

user.fullName = "Test"; // Error (property has only a getter)
```

### Smart/lazy getters
When a value is expensive, is not needed when the object is created/instantiated /or maybe is never needed) or it'll be accessed several times and there's no need to re-calculate the value because is never going to change. 

Lazy getters provide a solution using memoization where the result is cache and return.

#### How it works
The first time the `notifier` property is called, the getter is executed, the `delete this.notifier` **removes the getter method itself from the object**. Then, `this.notifier=...` creates a class property (not a constructor property) on the object, and then the property is return.

Therefore, subsequent calls to the `notifier` property are calling a class property instead of the getter. 

```js
const obj = {
  get notifier() {
    console.log("Getter called");
    delete this.notifier;
    // Simulating document.getElementById
    this.notifier = { id: "bookmarked-notification-anchor" };
    return this.notifier;
  }
};
```

>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20240830111624.png|200]]

Detail the `notifier` is represented as getter accessor property as it includes `(...)`. 

 

```js
console.log("First access:");
console.log(obj.notifier);
// First access:
// Getter called
// { id: 'bookmarked-notification-anchor' }
```

>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20240830112027.png|200]]

After the first call, the property is not any more a getter accessor property but a class property, so the value is fix and the expensive calculation was done once.

Subsequent calls to the "accessor" property are in reality calls to the class property. 


```js
console.log("\nSecond access:");
console.log(obj.notifier);

// Second access:
// { id: 'bookmarked-notification-anchor' }
```


## Using setter
Use set when there is a need to set the value of a property. Getters are use to give a value, reproduce or obtain, setters are to "create". 

Set must have only one parameter. 

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  surname: "Smith",

  get fullName() {
    return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;
  },

  set fullName(value) {
    [this.name, this.surname] = value.split(" ");
  }
};

// set fullName is executed with the given value.
user.fullName = "Alice Cooper";

alert(user.name); // Alice
alert(user.surname); // Cooper
```

## Deleting getters and setters
I can delete a getter using the `delete` operator. See the example above to know how to do it. 
## Conditioning the getters and setters
I can wrap getters and setters with conditionals or any useful code to control how the data is display or set. 

```js
let user = {
  get name() {
    // Using convention _
    return this._name;
    // However I can name it whatever. 
    // return this.myvariable = this.name 
  },

  set name(value) {
    if (value.length < 4) {
      alert("Name is too short, need at least 4 characters");
      return;
    }
    this._name = value;
  }
};

user.name = "Pete";
alert(user.name); // Pete

user.name = ""; // Name is too short...
```

>[!error]
>I can't use the same name of the accessor property within a get or set because this is like doing a 'cyclic' reference, therefore, I must use another name, but following the reference below. 

## About the use of this inside a get or set
When `this` is use inside a get or set, JS knows that `this` is referencing the accessor property, meaning, `this._name` is referencing the `name` accessor property. 

However, `_name` by itself is a property and can be accessed outside of the object declaration. Because this is possible, the naming convention (explain below) of adding `_` is required, so none will try to access or modify the `_name` variable.

>[!blank-container|float-left]
>![[Pasted image 20240828163526.png]]

For this reason is that the console is showing two properties. One `name` is the accessor property, and the other one is the variable that is used inside of the getter and setter method, that after the code inside of get or set run, is assigned to the accessor property. 
## Using this and accessor properties inside get and set
>[!warning]
>Inside of the getter and setter I can make a reference to the accessor property using `this`. Because `this` is going to refer to the getter/setter variable I can use any name, however, as a convention, I should use the same name but adding a `_`; that's why in the above example name become `_name`. 
>
>Additionally, this convention tell other developers the property is an accessor property that should not been access directly from outside of the object, but using either a get or set. The use of `_` is just a naming convention. 
>
>Also if my class is going to have getters and setters, then the use of `_` will be useful. 

>[!important]
>However, if I really need a [[22.5 Private class and static properties and methods|private field]], just use it using `#`.

```js
class Button {
  #value; // True private field

  constructor(value) {
    this.#value = value;
  }
}
```
