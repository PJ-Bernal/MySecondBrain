## What is useState and what are its elements
Add state to functional components (hey component, remember something). It takes an `initialValue` as parameter and **returns** an array with two elements: the `state` which holds the same value as the `initialValue` and a function to update the `state`.

The return array items can be used as variables once the state is set using the destructing syntax. Using the syntax is equivalent to having define the index and the set index constants.
This hooks has three main components:
1.  `initialValue` argument sets the **initial state** and it's only used during the **first render**.
2. `setState` setter function to update the state and triggers a re-render. This function can be call anywhere a new state is needed. 
3. `state` the **current** state value. 

This is the general syntax to define a state. The convention is to called the pair like `[something, setSomething]`. 

```jsx
// General syntax
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```

An import is required: `import { useState } from 'react';`

Every time a component renders, `useState` gives an array containing two values: the state variable `state` with the correspond `initialValue`; and the 

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
      <p>
        {sculpture.description}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```
