## Create an SSH Key
An SSH key is a cryptographically secure identifier that identifies my machine. GitHub uses SSH keys to allow users to upload to their repository without typing the username and password every time.

>>```bash
ls ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

If an error appears (`No such file or directory`), the computer doesn't have an SSH key, so I'll have to create one.

>>To create the new SSH key

>>```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"

>The `-C` flag is to write a comment, otherwise the key will be generated with my computer's name. This is possible, but the convention is to use an email. 

After writing the command, I'll be asked for a location (I can push enter) and for a password  (non-required). The result should look like this.
