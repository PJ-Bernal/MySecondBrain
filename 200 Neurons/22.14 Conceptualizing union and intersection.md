[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

One way of thinking about union of intersection types is seeing those as requirements. 
# About union types
"OR" types, represented by `|`, it means, I can use both sets of types. When using union think of the values the type is willing to accept, and what guarantees do I have when using the union type set in a function, for example.

If my union type is the numbers from 1 to 10, and a function is requesting even number, I might want to uses that union set there.

# About intersection types
"AND" types, represented by `&`. This type represents all of the values that are common in both sets. For intersection types, the requirement is that the values must be in both sets. 

>[!important]
>Union types are much more common than intersection types, because they allow to control flow.
