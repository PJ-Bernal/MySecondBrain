[[12.13 Node|Node]]

Node has some embed libraries, for example, `fs`. This library has a blocking method called readFileSync. So to read the file I have to require the library and then write that command; detail the `utf8` is required unless I want the file read in other encoding.

To create a file use the `fs.writeFileSync(<new file name>, <file>`. When this is executed, the file is created.
