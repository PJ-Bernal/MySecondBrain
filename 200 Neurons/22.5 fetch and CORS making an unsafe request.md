[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

Check the [[22.2 HTTP security|HTTP security]] note. 
## Example
Though there are three reasons why the request is unsafe in this example, only one is enough:
1. Is using the PATCH method.
2. The `Content-type` is not using an [[22.2 HTTP security#Safe requests|authorized value]].
3. Is using an unsafe header (API-Key).

```js
let response = await fetch('https://site.com/service.json', {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'API-Key': 'secret'
  }
});
```

The following example uses the javascript.info website to make a request to a site.com server
## Preflight
### Request
The browser on its own sends a preflight request that looks like this. Detail the first line contains the method and the exact path provide in the main request. 

```
OPTIONS /service.json
Host: site.com
Origin: https://javascript.info
Access-Control-Request-Method: PATCH
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type,API-Key
```

### Response
If the server gives a 200 OK response, future communication is allowed. Therefore, include other methods within the response makes sense. This example also allows PUT and DELETE headers. 

```
200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT,PATCH,DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: API-Key,Content-Type,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
```

Now the browser can see that PATCH is in Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Content-Type,API-Key are in the list Access-Control-Allow-Headers, so it sends out the main request.

## Actual request
```
PATCH /service.json
Host: site.com
Content-Type: application/json
API-Key: secret
Origin: https://javascript.info
```

## Response
In addition to the information requested, the server must send again the control origin header.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info
```
