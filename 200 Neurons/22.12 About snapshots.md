[[12.12 React|React]]

When writing a snapshot test, Vitest creates a snapshot file located in `_snapshots_` that creates an HTML representation of the component at that moment. The first snapshot will pass because the snapshot is created, and subsequent test are compared to this first version to detect any changes.

```jsx
describe("App component", () => {
  it("renders magnificent monkeys", () => {
    // since screen does not have the container property, we'll destructure render to obtain a container for this test
    const { container } = render(<App />);
    expect(container).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

However, snapshots don't track changes over time during a single test run; meaning if the component changes its form the test will fail, regardless if the component is functional. Component states are not compared in this test. 

This means, if the component changes according to its functionality (aria label, css class, or any other minor change), the test will fail even the component works perfectly. Snapshots can create false positive results. 
## The snapshot file
A typical snapshot file looks like this.

```jsx
exports[`component renders correctly 1`] = `
<div>
  <div class="profile-wrapper">
    <h2 class="profile-name">John</h2>
    <button class="edit-button">Edit Profile</button>
  </div>
</div>
`
```

## Use cases
Though snapshot test are bad, there are some use cases for them related to 'presentational' components:

- Tables or elements with constant DOM structures.

```jsx
test('ComplexTable rendering', () => {
  const { container } = render(
    <ComplexTable 
      headers={staticHeaders}
      rows={staticData}
    />
  );
  expect(container).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

- Components with static markup.

```jsx
test('StaticFooter maintains required SEO structure', () => {
  const { container } = render(
    <StaticFooter 
      copyrightYear={2024}
      legalLinks={STATIC_LEGAL_LINKS}
    />
  );
  expect(container).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```
