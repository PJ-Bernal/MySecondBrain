# About partial
By default, a class is contained in one file. `partial` splits the class, interface or struct, in multiple files. Thus, the code base can have multiple files with the same class, and all those parts are combined together at compile time. 

Classes' rules are the same, so in two files I can't have properties with the same name. It still "one" large class file.
## Use of partials
With default classes in VS or someone make a class. I can have a class with that default, let's say, tool generated code, and another class with my own code. 

Also, when working with large classes or multiple developers, its useful to split the class, in partial classes.

When creating a partial, the partial classes usually have the same class name follow by 'part'.
