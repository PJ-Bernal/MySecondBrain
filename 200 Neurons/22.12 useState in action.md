[[12.12 React|React]]

Having the state hook definition: `const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);`.
1. The component renders for the first time, the initial value is 0, then the index for the first render is 0, so the returned array is `[0, setIndex]` and React **remembers** 0 as it latest state value.
2. When the user clicks the button, it calls `setIndex(index + 1)`, index is 0, so `setIndex(1)`. Now, the new remembered index is `1` and another render is triggered. 
3. And so on.
