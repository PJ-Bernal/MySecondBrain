# About sorting
Sorting is apply to the fields of the resource, the DTO, and not over the entity models. Sorting here is on age and not on dob. This means, I can sort what ever field of the DTO, and then, I should be able to translate that to the entity, for example, I can sort something that is a calculation of id, first name, and dob.

Sort is made on resource fields and not entity fields. Sorting allow sort multiple fields

# Implementing sorting on resources
The og code.

![[Pasted image 20250206085502.png]]

The action method needs to accept an `orderBy` query string parameter, so modify the authors parameters class, with a default value. However, name is property on the Dto, not the entity model, so mapping is required.

In the repo, in the get authors async method; the order is done when an order by parameter is passed.

So do that before pagination, but before filter and search. This is only valid when the order by clause is Name.

Is working, authors are order by name.

The above code is not re-usable, so create a mapping service that maps a name string to a FirstName, LastName, this is, from the property names of the dto, to the property names on the entities.

I could write a ling switch statement for all possible sorting options by looking at the order by string, and that map the actual property, but that's not ok. 

So, install system.linq.dynamic.core. 

I want to be able to reuse this mapping system in all resources, so, separate that into an extension method on `IQueryable`. n
