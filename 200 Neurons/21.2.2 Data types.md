## Why does the type matter?
Matters because the data type of the field determines which functions I can use on that field, its behavior and even the render. Keep in mind especially for calculations. 

![[Pasted image 20231010221919 1.png|500]]

## Available data types
### Text
Thee default catch-all, if a field doesn't match anything else, it's a plain text. 
### Number
In the frontmatter don't require quotes.
### Boolean
The same values as always, true and false. 
### Date
Text that matches the ISO8601 (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss, everything after MM is optional) will automatically converted into a date object. 

Querying dates will give access to the following properties:

field.year | field.month | field.weekyear | field.week | field.weekday 
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | 
field.day | field.hour | field.minute | field.second | field.milisecond
### Duration
Syntax of time unit, like 6 hours, 7 days; with multiple units: 6 hours 30 minutes. 

Dates and durations are compatible when making operations. 
```
departure:: 2022-10-07T15:15 
length of travel:: 1 day, 3 hours 
**Arrival**: `= this.departure + this.length-of-travel`
```

```
release-date:: 2023-02-14T12:00 
`= this.release-date - date(now)` until release!!
```
Check how the examples are not within a dataview query, the last one is a inline query! 
### Links
Dataview and YAML (according to the documentation) requires this syntax "[[]]" to be valid. This is a link for dataview but not for obsidian. 

### Lists
They use the exact same syntax as my topic field in the frontmatter. However, use this syntax for inline lists.
```
Example1:: 1, 2, 3
Example2:: "yes", "no", "maybe"
```
>[!tip]
>Metadata using several times within the same note will be collected by dataview so I can obtain a list from it.
>>[!example]
>>grocery:: flour 
>>[...] 
>>grocery:: soap 
>>```dataview 
>>LIST grocery 
>>WHERE file = this.file 
>>```

### Object
Map of multiple fields under one parent field, they can only be defined in the frontmatter.
```
obj: 
  key1: "Val" 
  key2: 3 
  key3: 
    - "List1" 
    - "List2" 
    - "List3"
```
