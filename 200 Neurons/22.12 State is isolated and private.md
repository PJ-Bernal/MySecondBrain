[[12.12 React|React]]

Rendering the same component twice make each copy to have completely isolated state, so change one state won't affect the other. This means the state is not tied to a particular function call.

A parents component doesn't 'know' anything about its children state. Unlike props, state is fully private to the component declaring it. The parent component canâ€™t change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.

If two components need to share a state, then it'll be appropriate to let their parent have a state.
