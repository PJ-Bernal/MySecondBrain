The og code. Detail i n the route the hierarchy is reflected and plural nouns are use.

# Adding a 201 
The 201 created status code is better, for that use the `CreatedAtRoute()` method, using a route name, value and the actual value for the response body. 

The method return a `Location` header use to indicate the URI where the newly created resource can be found (that's useful for the consumer). This header needs the name of the endpoint responsible for that; so use the Name property on the respective attribute.

Think: what is the action method responsible for getting a new course? In this example, is the get course for author, so put a name on that attribute and use it in the crated at route method.

Pass the Name as the first argument, follow by the arguments that action method needs to work, in this case, authorId and courseId, as an anonymous type.

The second argument of the created at route, return the resource to return.

The argument the Named method use is the same as the parameter of the Post action method. When this happens in anonymous types use the inferred member functionality where the member name will be infer from the variable name.

## Testing
>[!important]
>When creating a resource the body of the request must match the fields of the DTO class models.

Detail the controller parameters have the exact same name as the DTO class model.

Detail the 201

![[Pasted image 20250204120144.png]]

Detailing the headers of the response, there's a location header. To check, use a GET request to that URI.

# Another example of POST
The og code has a problem because the parameter of the action method is using a DTO class model.

>[!error] Importantttt
>Because the outer-facing classes are different from the entity model classes, the POST action method parameters can't use an mode class DTO directly.

In the first example, the parameter is using a `CourseForCreationDto`, and not a `CourseDto`. This is important because the `CourseForCreationDto` is used to deserialize the body of the request into, and not directly into a `CourseDto`.

So, what's accept by the POST action method is different from what's being return, that's not the case the current example, both the parameter and the return type are `AuthorDto`.

The left represents the author class entity which is a direct representation of the entities in the db, this is how the fields in the db are created. The right represents how the user want to **receive** the resource.

Now, using the `AuthorDto` as an POST action method is a mistake, because the `AuthorDto` is not able to map, for example, Name into First and Last name, and Age into Dob. Also, this dto has an id, meaning, in theory, the consumer can send a request with an ID which is a bad practice as this is server work.

>[!important]
>The outer-facing model (the controller) should be able to differentiate between DTO classes (models) for reading, updating and creating. 

## Creating a DTO for create a resource
Think, what do the consumer need to create a resource. Detail there's no Id, property.

![[Pasted image 20250204122917.png]]

Then add that to the mapper.

DETAIL THE MAPPER IS USED TO CONCATENATE.

## Fixing the controller

### Testing
![[Pasted image 20250204123037.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250204123050.png]]

Detail the response now has an ID, and the concatenated name, and location headr.

The below errors are generated thanks to the ApiController attribute.
