When creating, a distinction is required when the server or the consumer is in charge of creating the URI. 

To create an author, send an author resource with the author representation in the request body, if the creation is successful send a 201 with the author representation in the response body and he location in the location header. Detail this request is made to the api/authors, detail the plural. 

Posting to a single resource (second creating resource server example) will never result in a successful request. meaning the request can't be done to api/authors/{authorId}. 404 if the author doesn't exists of 409 if the author exists. 

To add a collection, create a resource for that collection. 

Now, when the consumer use upserting, detail it can request the creation to api/authors/{authorid}, this is valid here, the response should be only 201.
