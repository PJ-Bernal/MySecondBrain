[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Programming with Ruby generally follows the next workflow:
- Write some code in your text editor.
- Save the code to a file in a particular directory. The filename should end with .rb.
- Open your terminal.
- Navigate to that directory using cd.
- Execute the file using ruby.
- Switch back and forth between the text editor and terminal, so you can make small changes in your code, and then run it through ruby to see what it does.
