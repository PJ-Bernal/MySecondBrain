[[13.2 Project management]]

## SRS
[question:: search more information of the srs within a web dev project]

## Wireframing
Wireframing is about helping the user for ideas about how they want the feature to work before start developing, by presenting the user with a visual aid to to understand what is being develop. It could be interactive or as simples as a quick drawing with a sit-down meeting; the idea is to present something to the user within minutes, if it'll take days, then, prototype would be a better solution. 

[question:: search examples and how the wireframing should be done with websites]

## Use case detail 
Even the use case detail document comes out of the waterfall style, it's used in OOP through a document langauge style call UML. 

A use case details, step by step, how a type of user (known as an actor) will interact with the system and what's expected the system in return. For now, this theory is based on a use case call 'system use case'.

[question:: does the user case detail document came from the waterefall style project?]
[question:: what are the two types of use cases, which one is more used within web dev]
[question:: this part has to be join with the other use case theory ]

## User story
>[!info]- Keys to a good user strory:
>1. Who will use it?
>2. What would they like to do?
>3. Why do they want it?
>4. What must it do?
### Basic common structure
"As **_a type of user indicated_** I want to **_perform a single sentence desired effect_** so that I _a**n indicated business value**_."

The 'so that I' section is often missed, however, it's important because:
- The user has an idea, but no real understanding if it will be of use.
- The user knows exactly what the end result should be and is dictating what they think the solution should be assuming you can't do anything else. This will generate a lot of re-work as you struggle to find what it is they are actually trying to solve, and an easier solution may have been possible if you knew the end result.
### Acceptance criteria, constraints, scenarios
- Acceptance Criteria - What will the users be testing on top of the simple sentence above to determine if the story is complete. e.g.: must have validation on screen if I don't enter this field
- Constraints - Are there limiting factors or outside concerns. e.g.: Must change the current sales process, Legal constraints, etc.
- Scenarios - How many ways can we see this happening? Are there different processes for different sets of data? Beware the words "I want it to always do this, every time"

## Use case diagram
The diagram maps the use cases or user stories needed to produce the system, and its interactions with the actors (person, system or time that initiates the user case and interacts directly with it, what requests the process to start).

When a use case (represent with an oval) interacts with other use cases it can either extend or include it:
- **Extend** – One use case may start from the other.
- **Include** – One use case always uses the other.

>The use case diagram allow to identify if the use cases or user stories are to broad, simple or lack of user interaction as the next example.

>The user needs to be more involve in the process and there whole application can't be summarized only with two use cases. Additionally, some process and needed only or always for making coffee; and, in this example, the developer has a direct relation with all actions.

>- Hot Water – Making Coffee requires this process (include)
>- Grind Beans – Making Coffee requires this process (pre-ground is not available currently (include)
>- Brew - Making Coffee requires this process (include)
>- Cream – Nice to have if the Developer wants lighter coffee but not always required (extend)
>- Sugar – Nice to have if the Developer wants lighter coffee but not always required (extend)
