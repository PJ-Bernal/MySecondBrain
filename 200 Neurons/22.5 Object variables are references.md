When any primitive's data type value is a variable, a copy of the value is hold by the new variable.

```js
let number = 10;

//anotherNumber will store a COPY of number
let anotherNumber = number;

//So, modifying anotherNumber won't affect number
anotherNumber = 200;

console.log(number); // 10
console.log(anotherNumber); // 200
```

>Objects don't get a copy but a reference, they have a pointer to the object provided, so changing the copy (the reference) will change the 'original' object.

```js
const obj = {name: 'Pablo'};

const objCopy = obj;

objCopy.name = 'Ana';

console.log(obj); // {name: 'Ana'}
console.log(objCopy); // {name: 'Ana'}
```

I can think of this like the object exists by itself, it doesn't require a variable to be. Thus, any variable is just a pointer to that object.

This explains better why when altering a variable that uses another as a reference, like the above example; in changes the original object.

>[!info]
>Variables can be re-assigned several times, objects doesn't affect this feature.

```js
let animal = { species: "dog" };
let dog = animal;

// reassigning animal variable with a completely new object
animal = { species: "cat" };

console.log(animal); // { species: "cat" }
console.log(dog); // { species: "dog" }
```

Objects that hold a reference works the same when the object is created using a literal or a CF., detail the above.

>This is extremely important because is how DOM nodes are alter. 

In this example, because there is a node object in the DOM called `container`, and I'm creating a reference called element. Thus, I can alter the copy, and the node in the DOM is going to take that change. 

```js
const element = document.querySelector("#container");
element.style.backgroundColor = "red";
```

## Example
Detail counter was modify, because inside the first function, the object is being referenced, thus, is being altered. In the second function a copy of the variable is being done, so when the function is called is printed 1, but the primitive is still 0. 
```js
function increaseCounterObject(objectCounter) {
  objectCounter.counter += 1;
  console.log(objectCounter);
}

function increaseCounterPrimitive(primitiveCounter) {
  primitiveCounter += 1;
  console.log(primitiveCounter);
}

const object = { counter: 0 };
let primitive = 0;

increaseCounterObject(object); // {counter: 1}
increaseCounterPrimitive(primitive); // 1
console.log(object.counter); // 1
console.log(primitive); // 0
```
