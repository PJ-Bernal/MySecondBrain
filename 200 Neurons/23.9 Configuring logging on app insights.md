Then add `WriteTo.ApplicatioInsights()` is an extension method that expects a telemetry config object:
- `InstrumentationKey`: unique id used to associate telemetry data with my app insights resource. Is located in the azure portal.

Then go to portal.azure.com -> all resources ->  search for the created resource.

Click on the desire one, then scroll down to app insights -> turn on -> apply. By turning this on, the app ins resource for the services is created and linked.

Click to find the instrumentation key.

![[Pasted image 20250203110600.png]]

Store the key in the app settings file.

>Now, to the read anything from app settings I need the builder, but the logger configuration goes before the builder. Moving the logging configuration after the builder is not good because anything coming from web application create builder won't be logged, and while developing that's something I want to see if something happens. 

So I can call `useerilog` to configure the login. 

So, leaving the login like this means, when starting up I want to keep on logging to the console and file, but not to app insights. 

![[Pasted image 20250203111046.png]]

Detail the serilog have the same settings, but adding the app insigh config. 
![[Pasted image 20250203111102.png]]

With the above config, local logs will also be stored in app insi, this is not quite good, because during local development I should be okay with just logging to the console or maybe a file. 

So, to change, it, first, only log to the console.

![[Pasted image 20250203111318.png]]

So, only use the console logging target when in development, so enable the file and app insi logger when not in development (when staging or production).

First, get the environment variable, and if I'm in development, log to the console, if not, we log to the console window and app insi

Save the file and deploy, right click on project -> publish -> publish.


# Additional configuration
Up to this point, request to any endpoints will fail.

![[Pasted image 20250203111747.png]]

To see the app insi log, logs, then write traces and run.

![[Pasted image 20250203111833.png]]

Instead of traces, for debug type exceptions to see the full stack trace. 

![[Pasted image 20250203112016.png]]

The error has to be with the system convert 64. The value authentication: secret for key, doesn't exist in the app settings file. It only exists in app settings . development. 


![[Pasted image 20250203112037.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250203112133.png]]

The key is not added to production. ALso this file don't have a connection string. 

![[Pasted image 20250203112148.png]]

Add the missing properties to production. Change the issuer!

![[Pasted image 20250203112304.png]]

Save and publish again. 

Then navigate to the swagger endpoint, authenticate and use the api.
