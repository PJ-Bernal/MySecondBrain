# About static members
Static members (fields, methods, etc.) can't be instantiated, but are defined on the class level and **shared** among all objects. If the static value change, then it'll change for all objects.

Static data is class level defined, not object level.

# Creating static members
Add `static` after the access modifier. 

Static methods methods are available only to be use within the class implementation, not for the objects.

# Using static methods
Using static members in the code base require the use of the class, instead of an object.

To modify a static variable, use the class name: `Employee.taxRate = 0.15;` this can be do in the source code if the access modifier is public. 

## About static methods and static data
Static methods can work only with static data. In this example, tax rate is a static field member within the class.

# Utility methods
Methods created within the utilities file (class) are static, therefore, they are available to direct use within the entry point, the top level statements in `program.cs`, without a need to use a specific class.
