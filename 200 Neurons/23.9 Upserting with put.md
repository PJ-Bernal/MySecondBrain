The og code.

To add upserting put support, change the put action method, don't create a new one. In this case, change the null check if the resource don't exists, if it doesn't, then it needs to be created.

Map the course from the request body to a course entity. Detail the second statement is setting the id to the course to the id coming from the URI, so the

Upserting require to allow the user, not the db, to set the id of whatever's incoming request. That's why the add author implementation is using Guids instead of identity columns.

Then add the course to the repo and save the changes.

Then return a 201 because I create something. The response body should contain the created course and a location header (like when posting). Map the added course dto, and then use created at route, passing the name of the route that will be use for the location header, in this case the get action method. 

Remember the third parameter in the create at route is the resource to return, which will end up serialized to the response body.

In this put, the author exists, but not the post. However, the request contain an Guid.

Detail the 201.

And the location header, has the same Guid the user pass,

The location header works with a get.

If the put request is send again, obtain the 204, because sending the same request result in an update, but this update didn't update anything; so put is idempontant.
