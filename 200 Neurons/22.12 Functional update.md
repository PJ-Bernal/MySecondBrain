## Direct update

## Functional update
When a state is going to be updated based on a previous created state, React automatically provides the current state **value** (returned by the last called of the setter function) as a parameter to be used in the setter function (`setState`) as an argument.

The value is there, so any name using in the functional update is valid. In this example, the functional update used the `prevCount` binding to represent the current state, and use an arrow function with `prevCount` as its argument. 

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
 
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      // setCound() returns a state value, so the next setCount invocation will be using that value as argument to update the state
     <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}> Increment </button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1)}> Decrement </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

>[!important]
>Is better to use arrow functions instead of direct updates, as arrow functions always use the latest state of the return value of the last setter function call.
