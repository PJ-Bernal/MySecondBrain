[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

While checks for an expression that resolves to a truthy or falsy value. Therefore I can use a `range` (detail big example below) directly, but within a variable.


>[!multi-column]
>
>```ruby
>while gets.chomp != "yes" do
>  puts "Are we there yet?"
>end
>```
>
>```ruby
x = gets.chomp.to_i
>
while x >= 0
  puts x
  x -= 1
end
>
puts "Done!"
>```

Detail I can combine while with the `gets` method, this works because gets has a return value of a string type. 

```ruby
# Initialize a variable
temperature = 20

# Define the range
acceptable_range = 18..25

# Simulate adjusting the temperature
puts "Current temperature: #{temperature}°C"
while !acceptable_range.include?(temperature)
  if temperature < acceptable_range.min
    puts "Increasing temperature..."
    temperature += 1
  elsif temperature > acceptable_range.max
    puts "Decreasing temperature..."
    temperature -= 1
  end
  puts "Current temperature: #{temperature}°C"
end
puts "Temperature is now within acceptable range."

```

## While is not implemented as a method
Unlike `loop`, therefore, while doesn't have its own scope, so the entire body of the loop is in the same scope as the code that contains the while loop.

```ruby
x = 0
while x < 5
  y = x * x
  x += 1
end

puts y # 16
```
