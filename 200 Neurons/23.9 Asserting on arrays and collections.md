This test is going to test a list of attended courses, which is generated with a call to the repo and the db.

This list is created by another method in the employee service.

# Creating the test
## Testing using objects
Create a class for testing the employee service class. The test is going to test is a course is within that list. This type of test needs an object of the thing I want to test, in this case, the course as an object. 

So, I want to test the attended courses property. This property is a list of courses that is created through the employee service class, specifically, the create internal employee method. 

having that in mind, to use the create internal employee method, I need an instance of the employee service class. Looking the first image on the note, to create a note, the class needs an instance of the  I employee management repository and one employee factory.

Because the repo for testing extends from I employee management repository, I can use the repo for testing, and the I only need the employee factory.

Therefore, first, create an instance of the repo for testing, and the use it along with the employee factory to arrange the test. Finally, get the obligatory course for the test.

 To test a collection, use Contains.

## Test with predicate
This other way of testing doesn't need an object of the repo for test, but a reference to what I want to test to. In this case, the contains method has an overload whose first parameter is the expected string, and the second is the actual string.

This method doesn't need to call the repository to gran a course.

## Testing multiple courses at once
This test relies on a method of the repo test which returns several courses at once. And then use equals.

## Asserting over all elements of a collection
Attended courses must not be new.

Or is better to use assert.all that runs through all items in a collection and execute an action against them.
