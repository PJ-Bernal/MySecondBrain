## Numeric grid area
There is an even shorter shorthand for positioning grid items with start and end lines. You can combine `grid-row-start / grid-column-start / grid-row-end / grid-column-end` into one line using grid-area.

```css
#living-room {
  grid-area: 1 / 1 / 3 / 6;
}
```

## Word-based numeric grid area
I can use words to position thing with the grid-area property. To do this, I have to target each grid element and give it a name with the grid-area property.

Once I declare a name to the grid elements I can use the `grid-templare-areas` property. Check [this codepen](https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/dyVPYpv) to see a full example. 

I can use `.` to indicate empty cells
