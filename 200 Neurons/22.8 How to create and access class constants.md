## How to access a class constant
### Accessing from the main script
I have to access them using the class name using `::`, known as the scope resolution operator. I can access the constant using the class name, so: `ClassName::CONSTANT_NAME;`.

Class are allocated once per class and not per instance, which means I don't need to have the instance (like in this case, the class object is not created) of the class to access the class constant. 
### Accessing from the object level
Here, I have the object created, I can access the constant through the instance. Detail instead of the class name I use the instance name, then `::` and then the constant, using: `$object::CONSTANT_NAME`

## Access constants within the class
### Using the class name 
Just use the class name and the scope resolution operator: `ClassName::CONSTANT_NAME;`.

### Using self keyword
`self` keyword refers to the current class where it's called. Is slight different from the `$this` variable, that refers to the calling object.

## Magic constant `class`
It resolves at compile time and returns a fully qualified class name. Though is written in lower caps, is still a constant. 

It work when calling the object.

Or when calling the class name.

## Use case
One use case is to avoid hardcoding constant variables used for any method of an instance over and over. 

As an example, given this transaction class, detail the code don't have any constant define, but one instance variable. Also detail the return type of the setStatus function is `self` (but I could wrote `Transaction`), because the instance is going to be return. 


![[Pasted image 20240507151709.png|center|250]]

Detail the method is returning the instance with a different status from the one the constructor have, because when creating the object I'm chaining a method to change its status. 

![[Pasted image 20240507151755.png]]

However, I'm hardcoding the status, so whatever status I type, is going to be applied, and there is no way I can catch this if I make a mistake; for example I could write `$transaction->setStatus('payd');`.

![[Pasted image 20240313120429.png]]

So I can have the constants define, and within the constructor code I'm going to specify as an argument of the setStatus method a self to a predefined constant. This way, in my source code I must always use a constant using the class::constant syntax. 

![[Pasted image 20240313120515.png|center]]
![[Pasted image 20240313120528.png]]

Up to this point, I can still make some typo errors, what if I type STATUS_PAOD. To solve this I can have some validation within the method setStatus, but doing this require bunch of conditionals, each for every constant. 

I have to create an if for every condition, so if the status is paid, or declined or what ever, then throw an error. More constants = more ifs. 
![[Pasted image 20240313120924.png]]

Is better if I create a new constant array in which the keys are the actual statuses, and whose values are NOT the constant values, but in this case, friendly names to each constant I can display to the user. That is why is `Paid` and not `paid`.  

>This array is called a look up table. 

Within the set status method, I'm checking if a given status exists in the all statuses array. If not, throw an error. 

![[Pasted image 20240313120806.png]]

The if check if the given status (the argument pass in the index.php file) exists in the all statuses array. If not, some throw an exception or something.

### A better solution
Here I'm coupling this constants within the transaction class. This class should be responsible for processing and working with transaction, not for storing status constants.

Then in the transaction class I can delete the constants, import the status class with `use`, then within the constructor I'm referencing the constant using `Status::PENDING`, the same within the set status method, chaning self to `Status::`

![[Pasted image 20240313121948.png]]

This is the final result, detail the code looks more readable and expressive.
