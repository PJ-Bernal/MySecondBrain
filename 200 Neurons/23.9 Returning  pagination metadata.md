# Generate the metadata
The og code

![[Pasted image 20250206083748.png]]

Detail the repo is returning a page list. I need to generate URI to the previous and next page if they exist. Use the Url helper class, its method link generate URi using the route name (get authors in this case) and some values.

First give get a name.

Then create a helper method to generate the links, this will use an enum resource uri type. So create that class first.

Add that to the helpers folder.

To create a link, use the link method, passing the route name and a set of values, which are the field names that match the query string parameters.

Then, back to the action method:

First, check if there's a previous page, this comes from the page list class created int he previous note. If there's a previous list, then generate by calling into the create authors resource uri,

Same for next page.

Then create the metadata, create an instance, with the values from page list. and the previous and next page just generated.

Finally add that as a custom header

# Testing
Look the header, it includes the previous page link, next page link. Detail this link is not unscaped (it include the \u0026), the front end should be responsible for that
