[[12.12 React|React]]

The third parameter of the `createElement` method is children, and when writing JSX the React element wrap its children like an HTML would did. 

```jsx
<button className="tw-button">
  My button // This is a children
</button>
```

So, the element wraps what needs to be render. This can be done a component/invocation level.

```jsx
function App () { 

  return (
    <section className='App'>
	  <TwitterFollowCard  userName='midudev' isFollowing/>
	    Pablo Javier Bernal // This is a children that corresponds to the userName prop
	  </TwitterFollowCard>
      </section>
  )
}
```

Do the above require two things:
1) Put a close tag into the app.jsx
2) Recover the children prop into the component function definition using a parameter called children, and then use the { } when needed within the function component.  

The parameter children refers to all what the element envolves. The children the function component uses is only ONE thing that is compose for all the things the element in the app is wrapping.
