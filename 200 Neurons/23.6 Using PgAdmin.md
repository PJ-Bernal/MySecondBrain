[[13.6 SQL]]

Having the container build, access the website address of PgAdmin and check in the docker compose file for the user name and password of PgAdmin.

First, start with adding the database, then go to the connection tab. The name of the host is NOT local host, because, when using Docker, the database is in its own 'environment'. Therefore, the host name is the name of the database within the docker compose file. Maintenance database is the 'container_name' field within the db part in the same docker file. 

On thing to notice is I didn't change the port, because postgreSQL is utilizing the same port, thus, 5432 works fine, I didn't have to use the 5433.

Once inside, to see the tables I have to go schemas, tables, click on the table name and click below the object field (above the screen) that says all rows. If I want to modify the table  I can click of the left button from all rows that says query tool. 

Now within the query tool window, to commit whatever change I made to the db, I can click on the save data changes.
