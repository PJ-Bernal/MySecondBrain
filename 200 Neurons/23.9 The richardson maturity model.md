# About the principle
Model that categorizes RESTful APIs based on their adherence to REST principles. 
# Levels of maturity
## Level 0 -  The swamp of POX (Plain Old XML)
The API uses the HTTP only as a transport protocol without leveraging any of the features of REST. it typically has a **single** endpoint `http://host/api` (there's no other `/` after the host), and use a single method, usually POST, for all operations.

For example, the endpoint  `http://host/api` is used to get author data or to create an author.
## Level 1 - resources
In this level the API introduces a resource identify by a unique URI, however, it still uses a single HTTP (POST) method for all operations. It extends from level 0 where only was a single URI. 

For example: `http://host/api/authors`, and `http://host/api/authors/{id}`. 
## Level 2 - HTTP verbs

The API use HTTP methods to represent actions on resources, including HTTP status codes to indicate results of operations.




## Level 3 - hypermedia
The API support HATEOAS. For example, a get request to the authors resource should return the list of authors, but also links.

>[!important]
>Level 3 is a precondition for a RESTful API, this model state then that there are not level 1 or 2 RESTful API; but there are different types of APIs, and only when reaching level 3, that's a RESTful API.
