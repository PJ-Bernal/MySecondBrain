# Creating a unit test project
Test are typically in a separate project; it will consume the application code. VS come with templates (using  some VS frameworks) for unit test projects called `xUnit Test Project` (used most commonly), and `Nunit Test Project`.

## Creating the test project

To add a unit test to a solution, right click on solution -> add -> new project -> search `xunit`. This will create a whole new project structure, with a new class (`UnitTest1.cs`).

>Naming the test is important, so change `UnitTest1` to something else meaningful.

### FACT
FACT is an attribute used by xUnit to understand the method that comes next is a unit testing method. 
## Creating a reference from the test to the project

To access a code base from the unit test project I have to create a reference from the unit test project, this will give access the unit test project to classes and the `program.cs`code base. From the unit test project, right click dependencies -> add project reference -> select the desire project to test. 

once done that the source code of the project to test must appear under the dependencies of the unit test project

# Structure of a unit test
Unit test have three principle steps:
- Arrange: define all the data the test need, creating objects, and built them with appropriate methods that allow them to work for the test.  
- Act: where methods are is invoked. 
- Assert: any class from Xunit (in the example above the `Assert` class is used) use to check if the data return by the method is the expected one. Validate the return value. Assert type offers other methods than equal. 

A unit test is a class full of methods, each one, that will perform a test follow the above steps. 

## Internal to public class
To test a class, change the access modifier from internal to public. If that class use another classes, like derive class, those classes also need to be public. 

# Writing the test
This is the signature of a unit test.

To write the test, remember to use the `using` to import the namespace of the class the code is testing.

This is the test file

# Executing the unit test
Use the test explorer tool of VS that will search for all test in the code using the attribute mentioned above. This explorer will run the test without running the application. 

To run the test, go to ta test -> run.
