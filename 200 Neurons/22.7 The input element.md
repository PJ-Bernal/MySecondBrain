## The input element
Is the most versatile form control element. It takes a `type` attribute which tells the browser what **type** of data it should expect, how it should render the input element, and allow the user to type in the form. Is render as the text-box, check-box, etc.

```HTML
<form action="example.com/path" method="post">
  <input type="text">
</form>
```

## Input attributes
>The following are the basic and more used input attributes, but there are much more to control even more the input. In addition each input type have specific attributes to control its behavior.

### type
Indicates the user's expected data type. Each input type might have unique attributes, but in some cases like in text inputs, they all share some common ones. The most frequent values are:
- Text inputs. They can use this common attributes: `readonly`, `disabled`, `placeholder`, `size`, `maxlength` and `spellcheck` if the browser supports it. 
	- `text`: allow the ser to type.
	- `email`: the form validates by itself if the user enters an email.
	- `password`: the text is masked with `*` or bullets.  
	- `number`: only accepts numbers and ignores any other characters. 
	- `date`: provides a better experience for choosing by rendering a calendar. 
	- `hidden`: the input is hidden from the user, (thus it shouldn't have a label associated) but is still send in the form; useful to send timestamps or other values. `<input type="hidden" id="timestamp" name="timestamp" value="1286705410" />`
- Image button: renders exactly as an img element, but when is clicked it behaves like a submit button.
- File picker: allow to send files to the server. 

There are [several](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#readonly) input types. 

### label
Label the input to inform the user the expected data type. Use the `label` element to put in between the label to render in the website. 

The `for` attribute is used to link the label to its input, thus, `for` needs a `id` attribute with the same value as `for`.

```HTML
<form action="example.com/path" method="post">
  <label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="first_name">
</form>
```

>[!important]
>Another way to associate a label with a form using nesting; but is always consider good practice to use the attribute for.

```html
<label for="name">
  Name: <input type="text" id="name" name="user_name" />
</label>
```

>When a label that is linked to an input and its clicked, it will focus the cursor on the input. This extremely helpful for radio buttons and checkboxes. 

### placeholder
The value of the attribute will be the placeholder text the input will show.

```HTML
<label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="first_name" placeholder="Bob...">
```

### name
The name attribute tells the backend where to send the data, what that piece of data represents; like a 'variable' name for the input. Name attribute is **always** required, otherwise, it will be ignored when the form is submitted.

```HTML
<label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="first_name" name="first_name">
```

In [this code pen](https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/dyVRMbq) i changed the age name and left a space on first name. The image details the response with the data was submitted.

## The request body
The pair name-value is what is known as the form request body. 
## textarea element
Though is not a form attribute perse, allow the user to provide resizable multi line data, like a review or comment. This element takes two attributes, rows and columns, that controls the initial height and with of the text area.

To link the text area I must include a form attribute whose value is the the id of the form element. 

```HTML
<form action="/action_page.php" id="usrform">
  Name: <input type="text" name="usrname">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
<br>
<textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="comment" form="usrform">
Enter text here...</textarea>
```

>Text area could be within or outside of the form tag. 

>[!error]
>The text area element the input attribute can't be use. If I want to put a default text, it should be within the elements opening/closing tags.
