[[13.4 Linux]]

Utility programs (known also as _services_) that run in the background (they are event and predefined-time triggered) are not interactive (initialize and execute without any human instruction), don't have a user control terminal (that's why [[22.4 What are UNIX PID and how they work#^79fec6|here]] the TTY is ?, there is no need of a control terminal for that process), and run regardless of whose user is logged into the server, to make sure the OS runs properly. 

## How to identify daemons
Daemons end with the letter d, like `systemd`. Commands like `ps`, `top`, `htop` are handy to view daemons, but `pstree` displays in full all the running processes.

## How daemons are created?
The process that creates daemons is the initialization (`init`) process by forking (creates an identical copy of a process) its own process. 

Another way is to fork a process, so when the parent dies, the child becomes an orphan that gets adopted by init. This is why some daemons could have a parent process of 1, Some daemons aren’t spawned at boot time, but are created later by another process that died, and `init` adopted it.
