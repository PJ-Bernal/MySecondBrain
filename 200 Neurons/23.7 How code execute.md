# How code executes
Code run through a compiler, that don't produce machine code to be processed by CPUs, but a binary file with an intermediate representation (called Intermediate language or IL) of the high level source code. 

The file produce by the compiler is called assembly (.dll or .exe) that contains the IL, metadata about the types, resources (like images, stings, or other resource the code uses) and assembly information (version and security requirements). 

The assembly file contains a lossless binary encoding of the high level source code, this means, tools can look at the assembly and understand everything about the original code. 

```c#
// Your original C# code might look like this:
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    [Description("Person's age in years")]
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

Thanks to the lossless, the assembly can be inspected at runtime:

```c#
// You can examine the assembly at runtime:
Assembly assembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
Type personType = assembly.GetType("Person");

// You can see everything about the original code:
foreach (var property in personType.GetProperties())
{
    // This will show both Name and Age properties
    Console.WriteLine(property.Name);
    
    // You can even see the Description attribute
    var description = property.GetCustomAttribute<DescriptionAttribute>();
    if (description != null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(description.Description); // "Person's age in years"
    }
}
```

## Machine code generation step
>-NET assemblies don't contain native machine code, thus, they can't be executed directly by the CPU. Therefore, an execution engine must be present on the target machine, which converts that IL into CPU machine code on a Just In Time (JIT) basis, before passing the code to the CPU.

This step (the machine code generation) is only done the first time a given method is invoked, the generated code is cached (.NET runtime optimization) and used for all subsequent invocations. 

>[!info]- See detail information here
>The .NET runtime maintains a code cache within the process's memory space. When a method is first called, the JIT compiler analyzes the method's IL code, performs optimizations, and generates the corresponding native machine code. This native code is then stored in a special memory region managed by the runtime.
>
The runtime maintains a mapping between the method's metadata token and the entry point of its corresponding machine code in memory. This mapping is stored in the method table, which is part of the type system's internal data structures.
>
For subsequent invocations of the same method, the runtime checks the method table. Finding that machine code already exists for this method, it bypasses the JIT compilation process entirely and directly executes the cached native code. This eliminates the overhead of repeated compilation.

>        // 3. JIT compiler generates native code
>        // 4. Native code is cached
>        // 5. Method executes

>        // Subsequent invocations:

>        // 2. Finds existing machine code
>        // 3. Directly executes cached code
>    }

This architecture works this way because the high level language, the IL, and the execution itself are all design from the beginning to support the efficient generation of machine code, if a only if, that code ever needs to be executed. If a method is not called, no time or resources are spend generating the machine code of its IL representation. If a method is called, the translation of that method IL into machine code is triggered within the execution engine, then, removes itself from the call chain for all subsequent invocations.

If a function is called 1000 times, the translation of IL to machine code occurs once, and then, other 999 invocations are carried out with no further involvement of the execution engine.
