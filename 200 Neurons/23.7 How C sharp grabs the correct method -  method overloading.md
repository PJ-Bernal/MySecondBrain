# How C# grabs the correct method
Three things are require for C# to grab the correct and unique method: its name, parameter types and arguments, and number of parameters. If any of this don't match the invocation, the compiler will show an error. 

This means, a class could have methods with the same name, but, with a different amount of parameters, for example; this is called method overloading.

# Method overloading
Method overloading allow to define methods with the same name, only if the number, type or order of parameters are different. Overloading allow to have methods that do the same action under the same name, instead of, `DisplaySumWithTwoNumbers`, `DisplaySumWithThreeNumbers`, just `DisplaySum`. 

```c#
// program.cs
DisplaySum(3, 2);

// utilities.cs
public static void DisplaySum(int a, int b) {...}

public static void DisplaySum(int a, int b, int c) {...}

public static double DisplaySum(double a, double b){...}
```

When invoking an overloading method, C# determines which version to use based on the provided arguments. As always, if the method return something, the variable type and the return type must be the same. 

## "Recursion" overloading
When the logic is similar, a method can invoke another one. This reduce code duplication.
