# Creating a version for a controller
Use the `ApiVersion` attribute, whose argument is the api version. poi is 2, cities is 1.  to version the controllers. Every action method or controller that don't have this attribute will be version 1.

# Requesting a specific version
## Requesting the default version 
When making a request without requesting a specific version, the default version is used, and that's version 1. Request to the authentication and files controllers will also work because by default, they are part of the default version, which is one.

However, making a request to an endpoint that's not within the default will cause an error. In this image, endpoints of poi are version 2, and no version is been specified in the URL.

## Requesting a specific version using a query string
After the base URL, use the query string separator `?` to specify a version with `api-version=<number>`

>[!important]
>At this moment, version 2 is only poi, meaning, making any request to cities for version 2 will cause a 400.

# Including version 1 endpoints in version 2
Use the `ApiVersion` attribute to apply any versions to the endpoints.

# Deprecate endpoints
Future versioning could make some endpoints to disappear, be deprecated. Deprecated methods should be flag as deprecated before moving to a new version so user will know before hand that endpoint will be deprecated.

To deprecate a method use the `ApiVersion(<version number>, Deprecated = true)` on the action method. In this example, the get field method is version 0.1 and is deprecated
# Testing
Now, detail cities endpoints are in API version 1 and 2.
