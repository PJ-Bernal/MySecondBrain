# About declaration files
Type declaration, or type definition files/libraries, are wrappers for existing JS libraries, that describe the types for all constructs (functions, classes, variables, etc.) to make sure the code base is using the library correctly.

Compiling the code with a type declaration file means I can find any type problem at compile time. These files end with `d.ts` extension. 

This files are created for almost any JS library, so if I need to use a library, check if it has a declaration file. 

# Where to find declaration files
When installing a library check for the TS logo. If a library don't have a declaration type, look onto the definetly type repo, this means, some declaration files could be not up to date.

To install declaration files, they are within `@types/<name>`, where name is the name of the library.
