Each security type has a unique security scheme type.


Depending on the scheme type other properties may be required. 


# Implementing authentication documentation
## Adding a security definition
Defined a security definition inside of `addSwaggerGen`.

Pass a name to the definition, the second parameter is an object of type `OpenApiSecutiryScheme` which is the same regardless of the type of authentication used.

However, different types may include more properties. For example, the image shows how to set up that for bearer authentication. 

>[!important]
>After `new()` write the OpenApiSecurityScheme to let the compiler know the type of object I'm creating. The above code could work, but is not right. 

The three properties: type, scheme and description are the minimal, but a complete configuration that enhance documentation is this one:

# Testing
The authorize button is added in the UI.

![[Pasted image 20250203093951.png|center]]

It requires a token, put the token, then go to  version 1 and try to get cities. 

![[Pasted image 20250203094024.png|center]]

Swagger returns a 401. This isi because the token is not sent as a bearer token in the authorization header in the request by the documentation UI. 
# Adding the requirement
So, invoke `addSecurityRequirement` on the setup of the security definition.

>Again, the Open...  After new is missing.

The `AddsecurityRequiremenet` expects an `OpenApiSecutiryRequirement` object, now I need to reference the Open API security scheme use when added the definition, to that create an `OpenApiRefernce` with a type as security scheme meaning I'm refereeing to a security scheme and the Id the name for the security definition.

The list can be used when using OpenId authentication where the user needs to provide a list of scopes. For bearer is not the case. 

After that should work.
