[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

Custom properties (or CSS variables) allow to reference a CSS value throughout the CSS file, so when I change a variable, its value will change in all places the placeholder is located. 
## How to declare a custom property
Use double hyphen followed by a case-sensitive hyphen-separated property name, like: `--color-error-text`, that's different from `--color-Error-text`, spaces are not valid here. The placeholder could have any CSS value, a color, a function, a piece of shorthand, etc.

## How to access custom properties
Use the `var( )` function, that takes two parameters, the custom property and several fallback values (that could be another custom property).

```CSS
.fallback {
  --color-text: white;

  background-color: var(--undeclared-property, black);
  color: var(--undeclared-again, var(--color-text, yellow));
}
```
