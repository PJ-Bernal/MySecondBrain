[[12.7 HTML and CSS|HTML and CSS]]

The form element wraps all of the inputs a user will interact with; it has two main attributes:
1. `action`: defines the location (URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted.
2. `method`: tells the browser which HTTP request method it should use to submit the form's data. 

>Is a container element like section or footer.

There are several HTTP request, but only two are mainly used:
1. `GET`: to retrieve something from a server. The browser takes the data, converts it into a URL and navigates to that URL. 
2. `POST`: when I want to change something on the server. The browser takes the data, bundles into a request body and sends it to the server. 

The skeleton of the form element is this:

```HTML
<!-- POST request -->
<form method="POST" action="/create-user">
  <input name="username" value="john" />
  <input name="email" value="john@email.com" />
</form>
<!-- When submitted, browser sends to server:
POST /create-user
Body: username=john&email=john@email.com -->

<!-- GET request -->
<form method="GET" action="/search">
  <input name="query" value="javascript" />
</form>
<!-- When submitted, browser creates URL:
/search?query=javascript -->
```

>Nesting forms can cause unexpected bugs.

## HTML structures used with forms
- I can use li, and ul or ol, with forms specially with checkboxes or buttons. 
- In addition to fieldset, for big forms I can use `h` and `section` elements to provide certain structure.

## When the data is not sent
Once the form is submitted all widgets that have a name attribute are sent, even if no value has been filled out.
