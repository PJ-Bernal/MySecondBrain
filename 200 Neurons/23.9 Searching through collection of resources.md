Search will use a search query to return all authors from which string fields contain the search query.

Add a search query string to the parameter list. Searching and filters should be combined, so pass the search query to the get authors method.

Then added into the implementation. Then and do the is null or white space for both parameters.

Only when both parameter are not null, the full list of authors should be returned. Now, the user can apply the filter, the search or both.

First, cast the author db set into an IQueryable of author, to work on that collection adding where clauses.

Then, add the search, first check if a search query has been passed, then trim, and use a where clause, which will return any author for whom the main cateogyr, first name or last name contains the search query.

Remember that fetching all resources and then apply the filter is a bad idea, because im fetching all the authors when I dont need to do that. In the implementation above, only the matching authors are return 
# Testing
in this case, it wills earch for an author that has pirate as first name, last name or category.
