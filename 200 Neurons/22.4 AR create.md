[[12.4 Ruby|Ruby]]

Using the new keyword will create a new instance of the class, but **is not mapped immediately** to the db. 

![[Pasted image 20240528212443.png|center|300]]

To map the instance once I have finish with it, to the table I will to execute `new_customer.save`. 

However if I use `.create` I don't require to save and the instance will be mapped instantly. 

```ruby
jane = Customer.create( name:  "Jane Smith",
                        email: "jsmith@mailinator.com",
                        city:  "Winnipeg" )
```

## Saving conditionally
Though create map the instance instantly, sometimes I want to some validation of the instance attributes, therefore I can create an instance and use an if.

```ruby
bobby = Customer.new( name: "Bobby McGee" ) # Purposefully missing the city and email.

# Save will return false if any of our validations fail.
if (bobby.save)
  puts "Bobby was saved to the database customers table."
  puts bobby.inspect
else
  puts "There was an error saving bobby to the database."
  
  # We can loop through all the validation errors.
  bobby.errors.messages.each do |column, errors|
    errors.each do |error|
      puts "The #{column} property #{error}."
    end
  end
end
```
