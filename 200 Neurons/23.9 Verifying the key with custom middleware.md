When deploying the key must be in a safe location, like an azure vault. For demo, the key will be in the app settings file.

# Validating the key
Validate in an action method of a controller is not a good practice. If the access to the api is full or not, creating a customer middleware is a better option, then add it to the request pipeline.

## Create the middleware
This is the middleware's boiler plate.

Detail the constructor takes a request delegate that can process an http request, it takes an http context as parameter, to have access to the full request. 

Invoke async method accepts the http context object. The `await _next(context);` invokes the invoke async method on the next piece of middleware in the pipeline. 

This means, the request delegate of the previous piece of middleware calls the invoke async on this piece of middleware. Once done, this middleware request delegate execute the invoke async method on the next one and so on.

### Implementing the async method
Get the configuration service to check if there's a key defined in the app settings. If the key is found, validate whether it's not null or wide space.

If the key is defined, find the key in the request either in a header or a query string. If is not found, return a 401.

If the key is found, compare to the key in the app settings. If is not equal 401.

# Add it to the pipeline

# testing
No api provided, then, message with no api key.

Then pass as a query string using the X-ApiKey. This returns 200.

Then as a custom header.
