[[12.8 PHP|PHP]]

Following the same examples using within this note. Within Paddle there is a class called CustomerProfile, and within the Transaction class I want to use the CustomerProfile class. Both classes are within the same namespace.

In this case, I can simply reference to the class using the class name. I only write the class name. 

This image is from the transaction.php file, and customerProfile() is within the customerProfile file. Because both files, the transaction and customer profile, are under the same name space, PHP can load the customer profile class from the transaction class.

>This works because PHP will try to load the CustomerProfile class from the current local namespace if I'm on a namespace file (that is the case because of the `namespace PaymentGat...`.

>[!info]
>PHP will try to load classes from the current name space, when I'm on a name space file.

If the Transaction namespace and `use` of the index is removed, a fatal error happens because PHP is trying to load the CustomerProfile class from the global space, and the class doesn't exists in the global space, because CustomerProfile is namespace to PaymentGateway\Paddle; it exists on a name space.

(In this scenario, if the namespace from the customer is deleted, is now in the global space, and no error is produced).
