[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

Callables are used to type a variable that can hold a function. I can define them with either alias or interface. the only advantage of using interfaces is that they are open. 

```ts
interface TwoNumberCalculation {
  (x: number, y: number): number
}

type TwoNumberCalc = (x: number, y: number) => number
```

When use a callable, there's no need to write the type of the function return type and the parameters.
