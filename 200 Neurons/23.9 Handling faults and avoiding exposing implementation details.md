Simulate an error.

Seeing errors during development is required actually, but in production.  
# Detailing the middleware pipeline

The code shows that when in development, use the `UseDeveloperExceptionPage()`, that's the middleware that shows the stack trace show above. 

Change to production

Detail there's not stack trace, that's ok.

ASP.NET Core by default by default use the exception handler middleware, that provides the 500 code without the stack trace. 

However, is better to add that to the middleware to configure it using an `appBuilder`. Use `.Run()` to pass the piece of code that will be executed if the pipeline is reached. 

This is better.
