[[12.12 React|React]]

## What is state
State "have different" levels, my state could be 'drinking coffee' or could be 'moving my arm to my mouth which I'm opening'. So, a state could be a modal overlay being displayed or waiting for visitor input, or I can split that state (be more detail), if the modal is open or if the input is empty. 

State is tracked with the data that produce it. When a component change, first, it has to remember things about itself, thus, state is a component's memory. 

## Why state are require
### Props and local variables
Check [[22.12 Data transfer between components - props immutability|the data transfer notes]] for information.

If a component don't use a state, is uncapable of **keep track** of any internal change (state). This doesn't mean local variables can't change, literally this means the component is unable to know what change, "only the variable know it change". However, when a component renders local variables are [[22.12 The re-render algorithm#Initial render|re initialized]]. 

Any change to local variables won't triggers any renders because React doesn't realize it needs to render the component again with this new data. Additionally, local variables don't persist between renders. 

For React to be able to work with state, it requires a `props` to track the current state of the component and change if require. If a component don't have `props` or use a local variable for trying to set the state, when the component renders for the first time React will use the local variable and won't re-render again (the re-render process is trigger only when there's a change in state, props, context or the parent component re-renders). 

```jsx
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  let index = 0;
  

  function handleClick() {
    index = index + 1;
    console.log(index);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
      <p>
        {sculpture.description}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

In this example there is an initial render when the component it's first mounted. When the `handledClick` function is called, it updates the `index` local variable, but no re-render is trigger. using either props or a local variable, the `index` variable in this example persist within the closure of the `handleClick` function. 

### What is needed to update the component
Two things are require to update a component with new data:
0. The use of `props` to let React have something to keep track of the changes.
1. Retain the data between renders. 
2. Trigger the render with this new data.

The [[22.12 State preservation|useState]] Hook provide those two things:
1. A state variable to retain the data between renders.
2. A setter function to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.
