The outer facing is composed by three concepts the consumer will use to interact with the API:
- Resource identifiers: the URI where the resources can be found.
- HTTP methods.
- Payload: optional; for example, when creating a resource the HTTP request body will have to contain a representation of the resource to create; the same when requesting a resource. The format is defined by the `Content-type` header. 

# What is the outer-facing layer in an MVC API
In a RESTful API, the outer-face layer is represented by all the controller classes defining the endpoints, how to handle the HTTP methods and the return status codes to the client.

## Detailing the action rest methods
For example, in this action method, when making a request and getting an empty list, that's still a valid response. Therefore, a not found status code is not possible here. In this

Now, in the get author method, detail the status code not found is required, meaning, the author id passed through reflects a resource that doesn't exist.

The above is a good approach, first getting the author, and then do a null check if the author exists, only if I need the entity afterwards; for example, for mapping. This is the **common approach** when the action method is for a single resource, grab it, do a null check and then return the not found or ok.

But if the entity is not require afterwards, the use an 'entityExists' method.

This is an example of the use of the 'entityexist' method. Why? Because the action method is going to return a dependent resource, in this case, the courses for an an author, hence, the action method can' return anything if there's not an author. 

Detail as well the author resource is NOT being use after the method call.

This action method combine the two approaches: using an 'entitiy exists' method, then requesting, do the null check and finally return it. 

The first call to `AuthorExists` can be done because the author resource is NOT needed later on the implementation, so this extra call to the db is needed. 

Also, when requesting the course, there's no use for any of the `CourseExists` method, but the actual entity is being called to do a null check.
