[[12.6 Git and Github|Git and Github]]

## Git add
Add the untracked files or directories to the stage area. The command `git add` has several flags, but I can add in several ways files without using flags, detail the how to add specific files. . Remember git commands are [[22.6 Git commands are context based|context based]]. 
### Flags
>The following examples will start with all files being un-staged. 

>[!info] `*`
>Adds the entire directory recursively, **except** for files whose name begin with a dot. Detail my cwd is the Test folder and the files outside are not affected. Detail `.gitignore` is not added to the stage area.
>![[Pasted image 20240514232350.png|center|500]]

>[!info] `.`
>Adds the entire **current** directory recursively, **including** files whose names begin with a dot or have been deleted. Detail my cwd is the folder and the files outside are not affected.
>![[Pasted image 20240514232700.png|center|500]]
>Here `delete.html` has been committed before, then it was delete; detail how only the `.` stage the deleted file. 
>![[Pasted image 20240514233344.png|center|500]]

>[!info] `-A`
>Stage **all** changes of the project, regardless what is my cwd. This is not recommended as all the adds and commits should be granular, remember [[22.6 What and where to commit]]. 
>![[Pasted image 20240514233949.png|center|500]]

>[!info] `-u`
>Stage changes to already tracked files only.
>![[Pasted image 20240514234735.png|center|500]]

>[!info] `-p`
>Allow to review interactively and stage specific parts of the code on modified files. 
>![[Pasted image 20240515000117.png|center|500]]

>[!info] `-i`
>Allow to review interactively more options to add.

Remember how Git treat new/empty/not empty [[22.6 Git file and project stages#^26e68d|directories]]. 


### How to add specific files
- Add one or multiple files I can list them by name: `git add index.html main.html`. 
- Add all files of the same type: `git add *.html` this command is context based, so if I want to add files under a specific directory I can provide the path. `git add directory/*.js`.

- How to add empty directories. This is important when having a directory called 'uploads' that is used for what the user will submit to the website and in some cases that is needed for the application. To solve this I have to [[22.6 Uploads folder and .gitkeep|use .gitkeep]], remember also how  [[22.6 Git file and project stages#^26e68d|Git tracks the directories]]. 
- Add directory and subdirectories: `git add <folder name>/`. The same can be achieve with VS Code, clicking on the top icon with three dashes, that will group all the file in the same way as my project. Then, I can stage files with +, and to commit add a message and commit.

## Git reset 
Use `git reset`  to un-stage all files. It has several useful flags:
- `<file/directory name>`: Unstage a specific file/directory.
- `*` to reset everything except files that start with .
- `.` to reset everything from the cwd.
