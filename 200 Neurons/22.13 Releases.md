[[12.13 Node|Node]]

## 22.7.0

- `node --experimental-transform-types <file name>`: allow to compile Node code using "not TS" types, like Enum and namespace.





- Prior to this version, a package.json file was require when importing a module within a TS file. The package.json file indicating the type module were required to do an import.

>>```json
>>// package.json
>>{
>>  "type": "module"
>>}
>>```
>
>>[!blank-container|float-right]
>>```js
>>// main.js
>>import { RGB } from './module.js
>>console.log(RGB.RED);
>>```
>
>>[!blank-container|float-center]
>>```js
>>// module.js
>>export const RGB = {
>>  RED: 'red',
>>  GREEN: 'green',
>>  BLUE: 'blue',
>>}
>>```

Since this version, the module detection is done automatically, so there's no need to indicate the type module within the package.json. 

- `node --experimental-strip-types <file name>`: allow to compile Node code using TS syntaxStrip types "erase" the TS syntax from node code. 
### Dev variables
I dont need to install do.dev and do the API_PPORT='3003'. Now, do this instead:

Then I can run `node index.js` and the return is 3003, so there is no need for dot.dev, or any other dependency. 
### Watch
Is stable now. `node --watch index.js` return 3003. So every time  i change the log, this happens

### Run
Any script within the package.json I can execute those scripts with `node run <script name>`. Is an optimize way of `npm run <script name>`. 

This approach is better because is package administrative agnostic, so regardless I use npm, pnpm, bun, etc. I can use Node itself to execute scripts. 

### glob
Using a pattern catch a group of files or directories. Ths is native now. The first param is the files or directories I want to grab, in this example all read me files inside of node modules. The second is a callback to manipulate the files and an error.

In this case, having a single index js file, executing node index.js return this.

See the node documentatoin to know which pattenrs I can use to search files.
