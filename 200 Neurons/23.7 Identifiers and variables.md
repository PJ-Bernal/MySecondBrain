# What are identifiers
Name a variable. They can contain letters, digits (can't start with digits) and underscores.

# What are variables
Variables are storage locations in form of computerâ€™s memory. Variables must have an identifier. In C# variables commonly have certain type. Remember the difference between of declaration `int age;` and declaration statement `int age = 10;` 

To declare multiple variables in a single statement, write declarations separated with commas. 

## Constants
Prior to the type, add the keyword const: `const decimal interestRate = 0.07;`
