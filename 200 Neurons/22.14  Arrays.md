# About arrays
Arrays in TS hold **the same** type, though in JS they can hold any kind of types. 

There are two ways of type an array: 
- Type annotation: `<type>[]`
- Using the generic syntax.  

```ts
// Using <type>[]
let strArray: string[] = ['some', 'test']; 

// Using type annotation
let strArray2: Array<string> = ['another', 'test']; 
```

If the array need to contain different types, use any, but try to avoid this. 

```ts
let anyArray: any[] = [42, true, 'test']; 
```

In React, don't type arrays with `Array<string>`, as the `<>` may cause a problem. 

Array's length is arbitrary, I cam pop and push elements. Arrays of fixed length are tuples. 

# Let and const with arrays
Remember, declaring a variable with const means the variable that hold a reference to the array can't be reassigned, but its content can be modify.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // Allowed: Modifying the contents of the array
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

arr = [5, 6, 7]; // Error: Cannot reassign a `const` variable
```

With let, both this can be modified, the reference and the content.

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // Allowed: Modifying the contents of the array
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

arr = [5, 6, 7]; // Allowed: Reassigning the variable to a new array
console.log(arr); // [5, 6, 7]
```

# Array functions
- Push: add elements to the end of the array.
- Unshift: add elements to the beginning of the array. 
- Pop: remove the last item.
- Shift: remove the first element.
Both return the removed element. 
- Splice: add items to an specific index, indicating the index, which elements to delete and what items to insert. This method returns an array with the deleted items. 
- Concat: concatenate two arrays. `firstArray.concat(array to concat, another to concat)`
- Slice: grab a specific piece of the array. 

JS copy arrays by reference. I add an element to one array but the two were altered.

To create a real copy, use concat or slice with no parameters.

Or is better to use the spead operator

- Sort: sort the array, this don't create a new copy.
- Tosorted: return a copy of the array but sorted.
- Reverse and toreverse. 
- indexof: return the index of the value pass as argument. The second argument indicates the index froom which to start, I can use the variable + 1, to search for the second element.

- lastindexof: returns the last index wheere the value is found
- Includes: search a value in the array.
- map: alter each item of the array.
- filter: allows to grab certain items based on a condition. 
I can chain both

- Array.isArray(): to check if a variable is an array.

- for: use to loop.
- for of: this will loop through every element.  
- for in: the variable in the signature is the index of the array.
