# About source maps
Source maps associated compiled code with source code. They are an 'intermediate' file between the production minified code and my source code. This allows me to review in the browser a file that is un-minified and commented. 

To enable source maps add `"sourceMap": true` to the ts config file. By default the source maps will be located in the dist directory. For development this is good. 

Source maps should be use only when developing, for debugging. 

To quickly know if source maps are enable, in the browser console, the line numbers will come from a  `ts` file.

# Debugging with VScode
To debug with VScode, a `launch.json` file is required. Run the app with vite, then click on the green arrow, then go to the source code in src and add the break points.

# Debugging in chrome
The source map property must be true, then. go to source and locate the .ts file.
