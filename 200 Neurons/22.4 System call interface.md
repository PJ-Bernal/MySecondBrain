[[13 Programming]]

Is the interface between the user spaces processes and the kernel to request a service. Thus, the processes can execute CPU instructions (they don't interact directly with the hardware) using the kernel on its behalf. 

Syscalls are functions in the kernel that provide services to a user space application. They are the API that the kernel exposes to user space programs, which allow a program to utilise the functionality the kernel offers.

A system call involves executing an [[22.4 Execution trap|execution trap]], but remember the [[22.4 Execution trap|execution trap]] is the interruption, and the syscall is the instruction made by the user space program to trigger the interruption.

To trigger this request, the user process triggers a special instruction that generates an interruption, transferring control to the kernel that executes the system call handler to check if the interrupt is a trap, error, failure, abortion, etc. 

Generally speaking, traps are generated by the CPU when an 'error' is encountered or attempts to execute a privileged instruction. System calls are initiated by the user space program itself. 

There are five types of system calls: Process management, file management, device management network management, and system information.
