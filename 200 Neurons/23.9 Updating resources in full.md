# Adjust the signature to async
Detail the signature is only action result without T, because the update method don't return any content. Then check if the city exists or not.

# Using map method 
The first parameter of the object in the request body, the second is the entity, the destination object, the method will override the values of the destination object with those from the source object. Meaning, the method will replace the destination object properties, with the source object properties.

Because the destination object is an entity that is being tracked by the db context, to persist the changes, call the save changes async method.
