To reutilize parts of a type declaration use index type with the syntax `<type declaration name>['<name of the property to use'>]`

In this case, the type of the house address variable is the type of address. 

If either city or zipcode are miss, a syntax error happens.  










## Typeof
The operator must take a value (not a type declaration like string, number) to be use the same as an index type. The operator will extract the types **only** (parameters, value and return value types) of the values and the apply that type to the 'attached' type. 

The variable using the type expect to use the exact data type (see the object example). With functions the operator recovers the return value as a type. 

```js
const point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
type Point = typeof point;

const anotherPoint: Point = { x: 30, y: 40 }; // OK

// 2. typeof with functions
function greet(name: string) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

type GreetFunction = typeof greet;
const sayHi: GreetFunction = (name) => `Hi, ${name}!`;

const address = {
    city: '',
    zipCode: '', 
}

const houseAddress: typeof address = {
    city: 'winnipeg',
    zipCode: 'r3f5g'    
}
```
