A mixin is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from it. They allow you to compose behaviors and properties from multiple sources into a single object or class.

Mixins are functions with a father class as input, and a child class as output.

```js
const calculatorMixin = (Base) =>
  class extends Base {
    calc() {}
  };

const randomizerMixin = (Base) =>
  class extends Base {
    randomize() {}
  };

class Foo {}
class Bar extends calculatorMixin(randomizerMixin(Foo)) {}
```

This other example implements a way to mix several mixins into one base class, without the need of chain them in parenthesis like the above example. **ojo**, the following method don't use `extend`. 

```js
// Mixin 1: Loggable
const Loggable = {
  log(message) {
    console.log(`[${this.name}]: ${message}`);
  }
};

// Mixin 2: Serializable
const Serializable = {
  serialize() {
    return JSON.stringify(this);
  },
  deserialize(json) {
    const obj = JSON.parse(json);
    Object.assign(this, obj);
  }
};

// Base class
class User {
  constructor(name, email) {
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
  }
}

// Function to apply mixins
function applyMixins(targetClass, ...mixins) {
  mixins.forEach(mixin => {
    Object.getOwnPropertyNames(mixin).forEach(name => {
      targetClass.prototype[name] = mixin[name];
    });
  });
}

// Apply mixins to User class
applyMixins(User, Loggable, Serializable);

// Usage
const user = new User("Alice", "alice@example.com");

user.log("User created"); // Output: [Alice]: User created

const serialized = user.serialize();
console.log("Serialized:", serialized);

const newUser = new User();
newUser.deserialize(serialized);
newUser.log("Deserialized user"); // Output: [Alice]: Deserialized user

console.log(newUser); // User { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' }
```

## Mixing and inheritance at the same time
Be mindful mixins are a way to borrow methods from one object, to my base object. So, this can be achieve using `Object.assign()`. 

```js
// mixin
let sayHiMixin = {
  sayHi() {
    alert(`Hello ${this.name}`);
  },
  sayBye() {
    alert(`Bye ${this.name}`);
  }
};

// usage:
class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

// copy the methods
Object.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin);

// now User can say hi
new User("Dude").sayHi(); // Hello Dude!
```

Doing this allow to mix the methods from one object, and still extend from another class.

```js
class User extends Person {
  // ...
}

Object.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin);
```
