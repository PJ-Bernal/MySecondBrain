[[12.5 Javascript|JavaScript]]

## Syntax errors
Thrown when the JavaScript engine encounters tokens or token order that does not conform to the syntax of the language when parsing code

### Catching a syntax error
```javascript
try {
  eval("hoo bar");
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e instanceof SyntaxError); // true
  console.log(e.message); // unexpected token: identifier
  console.log(e.name); // "SyntaxError"
  console.log(e.stack); // Stack of the error
}
```
## Reference error
Whatever variable you are trying to reference does not exist (within the current scope) - or it has been spelled incorrectly!
## Type error
This error may be thrown when:
- An operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function;
- Or when attempting to modify a value that cannot be changed;
- Or when attempting to use a value in an inappropriate way.

```javascript
const str1 = "Hello";
const str2 = "World!";
const message = str1.push(str2);
```

`.push()` is an actual method, but is an array method, not a String method, hence is "Not a function" I can find as a String method. 

>[!important]
>When facing type errors, always consider the data type you are trying to run a method or operation against. Youâ€™ll likely find that it is not what you think, or the operation or method is not compatible with that type.
