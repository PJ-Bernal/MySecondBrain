[[12.14 Typescript|Typescript]]

`interface` and `type` are TS mechanisms to give names to the types, and use them across modules. 

# About type aliases
Type alias allow to give a name to the type and define its shape. I can also export and import a type like a JS module.

To define a type: `type <type name in PascalCase> = {<type properties>}`, and then use it calling its name

```ts
type Amount = {
  currency: string
  value: number
}

function printAmount(amt: Amount) {
    console.log(amt)

    const { currency, value } = amt
    console.log(`${currency} ${value}`)
}
```

Remember everything is about the type, because TS is structural typed. The code works because the object argument donation has the required shape for the print amount function, that is an parameter of type Amount. 

```ts
const donation = {
    currency: "USD",
    value: 30.0,
    description: "Donation to food bank",
}

printAmount(donation) //✔️ Valid
```

Types can hold any type supported in TS: `type IsNull = string | null`. 

In past notes my code define two tuples for a success and a failure scenario, I can make those a type. The first two are a read only tuple, and the last one is the union of both types. 

```ts
type UserInfoOutcomeError = readonly ["error", Error]
type UserInfoOutcomeSuccess = readonly [
    "success",
    { readonly name: string; readonly email: string },
]
type UserInfoOutcome =
    | UserInfoOutcomeError
    | UserInfoOutcomeSuccess
```

# Inheritance with type alias
I can create compound types, using default types, with the intersection operator. This allows to create a type alias that is a subtype of a base type; this example shows a subtype of a date. So if I need a date and I use new years eve, that will work. 

Now, the variable has the method I chain to its type definition.

```ts
// Define the new compunt type
type SpecialDate = Date & { getDescription(): string }

// Create a new date of type special date
const newYearsEve: SpecialDate = Object.assign(
        new Date(),
        { getDescription: () => "Last day of the year" }
    )

newYearsEve.getDescription
```


# About extends and implements
Type alias can extend, but I can use inheritance.

```ts
type Animal = {
    isAlive(): boolean;
};

// Extending a type alias using intersection
type Mammal = Animal & {
    getFurOrHairColor(): string;
};

// Usage
const myMammal: Mammal = {
    isAlive: () => true,
    getFurOrHairColor: () => "brown",
};
```

But I can implement type alias **only** if the type represents an object type.

```ts
type CanJump = {
    jumpToHeight(): number;
};

class Dog implements CanJump {
    jumpToHeight() {
        return 1.7;
    }
}
```
