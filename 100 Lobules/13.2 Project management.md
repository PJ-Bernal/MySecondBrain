# Table of content
## Project methodologies
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.2") and contains(tags, "methodologies")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```
## Project styles and requirements
How you start and work on a project depends on what methodology you use, they change how and when gather requirements and when deliver them. 
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.2") and contains(tags, "requirements")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```
## Domain driven model
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.2") and contains(tags, "domain_driven_model")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```

[question:: BDD vs DDD, which is better and why, where to use each ]

- [ ] Remember identifying objects, class responsibilities, example and testing  are a single topic that is identifying the attributes and classes. They are not only for DDD nor OOP nor BDD, so think on separate those two in a unique title.
## Behavior driven model
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.2") and contains(tags, "behavior_driven_model")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```





- [ ] Software requirements by Karl Wiegers and Mastering the requirements process by suzanne are good books to learn about requirements. 
- [ ] # Writing Effective Use Cases Book for use cases
- [ ] # User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development, for user stories, read recommended for scrum or extreme programming.
- [ ] Remember [[13.1 OO Programming]] is a parallel topic with this one. 
- [ ] Domain driven desing destilled by vaugh vernon book. 
- [ ] [This webpage](https://docs.cucumber.io/) is useful to learn more about acceptance criteria and user stories.
