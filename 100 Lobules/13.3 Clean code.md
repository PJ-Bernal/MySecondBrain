# Table of content
## About clean code
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.3") and contains(tags, "about_clean_code")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```

## Recursive methods
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.3") and contains(tags, "recursion")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```


## Time complexity
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.3") and contains(tags, "time_complexity")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```
