# Theory
## Basic PHP
>[!multi-column]
>
>Most of the things explain in this section are procedural PHP, meaning an application or program is divided into a set of functions that operate on some sort of data store in variables.

### Servers
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions", resources
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(note_type, "note") and contains(tags, "php/server")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```

### Syntax
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions", resources

## Intermediate PHP
>[!multi-column]
>
>In PHP OOP, functions and variables are combined into classes to create objects. I can access variables and call functions if the object is public. The objects of the class are called properties, and the functions as methods.

| [Programming with Gio](https://www.youtube.com/@ProgramWithGio) | Learn all the syntax, procedural and OOP. Excellent videos and resources. |

# To-do
- Search more information about the destructor method. 
- Search for that videos bout htaccess files
- Search more about the composer
- Take the laracast tutorial about php
- I don't finish the docker video 
- Search more about virtual host and apache configuration server in general
- Search more about the configuration file php.ini
- think of a way to relate the OOP concepts from here to the 13 OOp from the book.
