# Table of content
## Introduction
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.1") and contains(tags, "introduction")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```

- [ ] Distribute better, maybe attributes, methods and states in one note. 

## Four fundamental principles
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.1") and contains(tags, "four_fundamentals")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```

## How to think in terms of Objects
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.1") and contains(tags, "oo_thinking")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```

Here ends the basics of OO programming. 
## Advanced principles
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.1") and contains(tags, "advanced_principles")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```
## The anatomy of a class
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.1") and contains(tags, "class_anatomy")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```

## Class design guidelines
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.1") and contains(tags, "design_guidelines")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```


## SOLID principles
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.1") and contains(tags, "solid")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```
