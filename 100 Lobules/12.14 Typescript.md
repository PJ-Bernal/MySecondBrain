## Introduction
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",   dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "22.14") and contains(tags, "introduction")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```

WHERE contains(file.name, "22.14") and contains(tags, "syntax")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```

```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",   dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "22.14") and contains(tags, "data_types")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```
