# The language
## Basic
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "22.5") and contains(tags, "introduction")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```
## Data types
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"

## Organizing the code
JS as a forgiving language allows to organize code is multiple ways. Though there are several patterns of design, the most common are:
- Plain Old JavaScript Objects and Object Constructors
- Factory Functions and the Module Pattern
- Classes
- ES6 Modules
### Object design pattern
For this topic in specific, check all the notes in Object for clarifications, everything is there...
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "22.5") and contains(tags, "object_design_pattern")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```

### Factory Functions and the module pattern
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "22.5") and contains(tags, "factory_function")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```

### The module pattern
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "22.5") and contains(tags, "module_pattern")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```

### Classes
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "22.5") and contains(tags, "classes")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```


## ES6 Modules
```dataview

FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "22.5") and contains(tags, "modules")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```

## npm

FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```
