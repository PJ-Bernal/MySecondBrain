## The UNIX shell
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note", dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", resources AS "Resources", checked
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.4") AND contains(note_type, "note") AND contains(tags, "introduction")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```
