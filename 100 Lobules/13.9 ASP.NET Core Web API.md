# MVC APIs
## About ASP.NET Core
### Introduction
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
FROM "200 Neurons"
WHERE contains(file.name, "23.9") and econtains(tags, "about")
FLATTEN substring(file.name, 5) AS short
SORT file.ctime ASC
```
### Templates
```dataview 
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, short) AS "Note",  dateformat(file.ctime,"yyyy-MM-dd") AS "Creation date", question AS "Questions"
